AB  - Synthetic data generation has emerged as a crucial topic for financial institutions, driven by multiple factors, such as privacy protection and data augmentation. Many algorithms have been proposed for synthetic data generation but reaching the consensus on which method we should use for the specific data sets and use cases remains challenging. Moreover, the majority of existing approaches are "unsupervised" in the sense that they do not take into account the downstream task. To address these issues, this work presents a novel synthetic data generation framework. The framework integrates a supervised component tailored to the specific downstream task and employs a meta-learning approach to learn the optimal mixture distribution of existing synthetic distributions.

AB  - Synthetic data generation addresses the challenges of obtaining extensive empirical datasets, offering benefits such as cost-effectiveness, time efficiency, and robust model development. Nonetheless, synthetic data-generation methodologies still encounter significant difficulties, including a lack of standardized metrics for modeling different data types and comparing generated results. This study introduces PVS-GEN, an automated, general-purpose process for synthetic data generation and verification. The PVS-GEN method parameterizes time-series data with minimal human intervention and verifies model construction using a specific metric derived from extracted parameters. For complex data, the process iteratively segments the empirical dataset until an extracted parameter can reproduce synthetic data that reflects the empirical characteristics, irrespective of the sensor data type. Moreover, we introduce the PoR metric to quantify the quality of the generated data by evaluating its time-series characteristics. Consequently, the proposed method can automatically generate diverse time-series data that covers a wide range of sensor types. We compared PVS-GEN with existing synthetic data-generation methodologies, and PVS-GEN demonstrated a superior performance. It generated data with a similarity of up to 37.1% across multiple data types and by 19.6% on average using the proposed metric, irrespective of the data type.

AB  - Synthetic data generation is one of the methods used in machine learning to increase the performance of algorithms on datasets. However, these methods do not ensure success on each dataset. In this study, it has been investigated that which type of synthetic data generation algorithms are useful in which datasets by examining the effects of SMOTE, Borderline-SMOTE and Random data generation algorithms on 33 datasets. For this, each dataset has been fully balanced as a result of synthetic data generation. In order to evaluate the results, datasets are divided into three groups as balanced, partially balanced-unbalanced and unbalanced in accordance with the unbalance ratio. The datasets formed as a result of the data generation of the algorithms and the original datasets have been trained with an ANN models and their performance has been evaluated on the test set. Experimental results have shown that adding synthetic data to the datasets with the abovementioned algorithms generally increases the success in balanced and partially balanced-unbalanced datasets, but generally does not work in unbalanced datasets. Borderline-SMOTE, which produces border samples in balanced datasets, and SMOTE in partially balanced-unbalanced datasets have been more successful.

AB  - Objective: Deep learning-based object recognition, 6D pose estimation, and semantic scene understanding require a large amount of training data to achieve generalization. Time-consuming annotation processes, privacy, and security aspects lead to a scarcity of real-world datasets. To overcome this lack of data, synthetic data generation has been proposed, including multiple facets in the area of domain randomization to extend the data distribution. The objective of this review is to identify methods applied for synthetic data generation aiming to improve 6D pose estimation, object recognition, and semantic scene understanding in indoor scenarios. We further review methods used to extend the data distribution and discuss best practices to bridge the gap between synthetic and real-world data. Methods: We adhered to the guidelines of the systematic PRISMA technique. Three databases, IEEE Xplore, Springer Link, and ACM, and an additional manual search were conducted. In total, we identified 241 studies and included 34 in our systematic review. Conclusion: In summary, synthetic data generation has been performed using crop-out methods, graphic APIs, 3D modeling or authoring tools, or game engine-based methods. To extend the data distribution, varying scene parameters, i.e., lighting conditions or textures and the use of distracting objects in the scene are promising.

AB  - Synthetic data serves as an alternative in training machine learning models, particularly when real-world data is limited or inaccessible. However, ensuring that synthetic data mirrors the complex nuances of real-world data is a challenging task. This paper addresses this issue by exploring the potential of integrating data-centric AI techniques which profile the data to guide the synthetic data generation process. Moreover, we shed light on the often ignored consequences of neglecting these data profiles during synthetic data generation - despite seemingly high statistical fidelity. Subsequently, we propose a novel framework to evaluate the integration of data profiles to guide the creation of more representative synthetic data. In an empirical study, we evaluate the performance of five state-of-the-art models for tabular data generation on eleven distinct tabular datasets. The findings offer critical insights into the successes and limitations of current synthetic data generation techniques. Finally, we provide practical recommendations for integrating data-centric insights into the synthetic data generation process, with a specific focus on classification performance, model selection, and feature selection. This study aims to reevaluate conventional approaches to synthetic data generation and promote the application of data-centric AI techniques in improving the quality and effectiveness of synthetic data.

AB  - To date, the use of synthetic data generation techniques in the health and wellbeing domain has been mainly limited to research activities. Although several open source and commercial packages have been released, they have been oriented to generating synthetic data as a standalone data preparation process and not integrated into a broader analysis or experiment testing workflow. In this context, the VITALISE project is working to harmonize Living Lab research and data capture protocols and to provide controlled processing access to captured data to industrial and scientific communities. In this paper, we present the initial design and implementation of our synthetic data generation approach in the context of VITALISE Living Lab controlled data processing workflow, together with identified challenges and future developments. By uploading data captured from Living Labs, generating synthetic data from them, developing analysis locally with synthetic data, and then executing them remotely with real data, the utility of the proposed workflow has been validated. Results have shown that the presented workflow helps accelerate research on artificial intelligence, ensuring compliance with data protection laws. The presented approach has demonstrated how the adoption of state-of-the-art synthetic data generation techniques can be applied for real-world applications.

AB  - Data is a crucial component in machine learning. However, many datasets contain sensitive information such as personally identifiable health and financial data. Access to these datasets must be restricted to avoid potential security concerns. Synthetic data generation addresses this problem by generating artificial data that are similar to, and thus could be used in place of, the original real-world data. This research introduces a synthetic data generation approach called CT-VAE that uses Combinatorial Testing (CT) and Variational Autoencoder (VAE). We first use VAE to learn the distribution of the real-world data and encode it in a latent, lower-dimensional space. Next, we use CT to sample the latent space by generating a t-way set of latent vectors, each of which represents a data point in the latent space. A synthetic dataset is generated from the t-way set by decoding each latent vector in the set. Our experimental evaluation suggests that machine learning models trained with synthetic datasets generated using our approach could achieve performance that is very similar to those trained with real-world datasets. Furthermore, our approach performs better than several state-of-the-art synthetic data generation approaches.

AB  - One of the main limitations of the application of Deep Learning (DL) algorithms is when dealing with problems with small data. One workaround to this issue is the use of synthetic data generators. In this framework, we explore the benefits of synthetic data generation as a surrogate for the lack of large data when applying DL algorithms. In this paper, we propose a problem of learning to count the number of pedestrians using synthetic images as a substitute for real images. To this end, we introduce an algorithm to create synthetic images for being fed to a designed Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) to learn from. The model is capable of accurately counting the number of individuals in a real scene.

AB  - Nowadays, the use of synthetic data has gained popularity as a cost-efficient strategy for enhancing data augmentation for improving machine learning models performance as well as addressing concerns related to sensitive data privacy. Therefore, the necessity of ensuring quality of generated synthetic data, in terms of accurate representation of real data, consists of primary importance. In this work, we present a new framework for evaluating synthetic data generation models' ability for developing high-quality synthetic data. The proposed approach is able to provide strong statistical and theoretical information about the evaluation framework and the compared models' ranking. Two use case scenarios demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework for evaluating the ability of synthetic data generation models to generated high quality data.

AB  - Sensor network research is still in its infancy. There is a large volume of exploratory research. Front lack of experimental data and sophisticated models derived from such data, many sensor network publications continue to use data generated from simple models in their algorithm evaluation. It is commonly agreed that data processing algorithms in sensor networks are sensitive to input data. However, no previous efforts have been devoted to quantitatively characterize the range of the algorithm performance when evaluated using different data input.
   In this paper, we made the first attempt to quantify the algorithm's sensitivity to data. Our evaluation results demonstrated that different data input could change the algorithm performance by as much as an order of magnitude or event change the relative performance order of two alternative algorithms. This pointed out the need to evaluate sensor network systems with data representing a wide range of real-world scenarios. For each algorithm in our case study, we identified a small set of data characteristics essential to the algorithm's performance. This defined a unique feature of our synthetic data generation framework and made both synthetic data generation and evaluation scalable. To support systematic algorithm evaluation and robust algorithm design and deployment, our synthetic data generation toolbox can generate 1. irregular topology data based on empirical models which will maintain important features of the experimental data; and 2. data corresponding to a wide range of parameter values.

AB  - Generative adversarial networks have become a de facto approach to generate synthetic data points that resemble their real counterparts. We tackle the situation where the realism of individual samples is not the sole criterion for synthetic data generation. Additional constraints such as privacy preservation, distribution realism, and diversity promotion may also be essential to optimize. To address this challenge, we introduce HydraGAN, a multi-agent network that performs multi-objective synthetic data generation. We theoretically verify that training the HydraGAN system, containing a single generator and an arbitrary number of discriminators, leads to a Nash equilibrium. Experimental results for six datasets indicate that HydraGAN consistently outperforms prior methods in maximizing the Area under the Radar Chart, balancing a combination of cooperative or competitive data generation goals.

AB  - Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising solution to overcome the challenges which are posed by data scarcity and privacy concerns, as well as, to address the need for training artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms on unbiased data with sufficient sample size and statistical power. Our review explores the application and efficacy of synthetic data methods in healthcare considering the diversity of medical data. To this end, we systematically searched the PubMed and Scopus databases with a great focus on tabular, imaging, radiomics, time-series, and omics data. Studies involving multi-modal synthetic data generation were also explored. The type of method used for the synthetic data generation process was identified in each study and was categorized into statistical, probabilistic, machine learning, and deep learning. Emphasis was given to the programming languages used for the implementation of each method. Our evaluation revealed that the majority of the studies utilize synthetic data generators to: (i) reduce the cost and time required for clinical trials for rare diseases and conditions, (ii) enhance the predictive power of AI models in personalized medicine, (iii) ensure the delivery of fair treatment recommendations across diverse patient populations, and (iv) enable researchers to access highquality, representative multimodal datasets without exposing sensitive patient information, among others. We underline the wide use of deep learning based synthetic data generators in 72.6 % of the included studies, with 75.3 % of the generators being implemented in Python. A thorough documentation of open-source repositories is finally provided to accelerate research in the field.

AB  - The increasing prevalence of chronic non-communicable diseases makes it a priority to develop tools for enhancing their management. On this matter, Artificial Intelligence algorithms have proven to be successful in early diagnosis, prediction and analysis in the medical field. Nonetheless, two main issues arise when dealing with medical data: lack of high-fidelity datasets and maintenance of patient's privacy. To face these problems, different techniques of synthetic data generation have emerged as a possible solution. In this work, a framework based on synthetic data generation algorithms was developed. Eight medical datasets containing tabular data were used to test this framework. Three different statistical metrics were used to analyze the preservation of synthetic data integrity and six different synthetic data generation sizes were tested. Besides, the generated synthetic datasets were used to train four different supervised Machine Learning classifiers alone, and also combined with the real data. F1-score was used to evaluate classification performance. The main goal of this work is to assess the feasibility of the use of synthetic data generation in medical data in two ways: preservation of data integrity and maintenance of classification performance.

AB  - The growth of data publishing, sharing, and mining mechanisms in various fields of industry and science has led to an increase in the flow of data, making it an important asset that needs to be protected and managed effectively. To this end, different mechanisms have been used across different domains, including Privacy Enhancing Technologies like Synthetic Data Generation, which aim to protect user-sensitive data and prevent misuse among different domains. Then, Synthetic data has been used not only to augment datasets and balance classes but also in applications of data analysis paradigms that aim to provide useful insights in terms of utility while preserving the privacy of sensitive data. Still, there is a gap in the conceptual and state-of-the-art understanding of the level of privacy synthetic data generators can provide and how they affect various industries and fields. This systematic review attempts to address how privacy has been assessed and measured in the framework of synthetic data generation, and getting to know which metrics have been used to evaluate those mechanisms. We provide an overview with a total of 105 recent studies in this field after a screening process and identify future open research directions. The main findings include a high prevalence of differential privacy as a privacy-preserving technique and privacy budget cost as a trade-off metric, with a high percentage of GAN-based model implementations, and mainly healthcare applications. Our systematic review covers multiple privacy domains and can be understood as a general framework for privacy measurement applied in Synthetic Data Generation.

AB  - Preservation of private user data is of paramount importance for high Quality of Experience (QoE) and acceptability, particularly with services treating sensitive data, such as IT-based health services. Whereas anonymization techniques were shown to be prone to data re-identification, synthetic data generation has gradually replaced anonymization since it is relatively less time and resource-consuming and more robust to data leakage. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been used for generating synthetic datasets, especially GAN frameworks adhering to the differential privacy phenomena. This research compares state-of-the-art GAN-based models for synthetic data generation to generate time-series synthetic medical records of dementia patients which can be distributed without privacy concerns. Predictive modeling, autocorrelation, and distribution analysis are used to assess the Quality of Generating (QoG) of the generated data. The privacy preservation of the respective models is assessed by applying membership inference attacks to determine potential data leakage risks. Our experiments indicate the superiority of the privacy-preserving GAN (PPGAN) model over other models regarding privacy preservation while maintaining an acceptable level of QoG. The presented results can support better data protection for medical use cases in the future.

AB  - Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) in 5G networks has emerged as a promising technology to enable efficient and low-latency services for mobile users. In this paper, we present a novel synthetic data generation approach tailored for evaluating MEC in 5G networks. Our methodology incorporates resource-efficient techniques to generate realistic synthetic datasets that capture the spatio-temporal patterns of mobile traffic and user behavior. By leveraging advanced modeling techniques, including multi-head attention and bidirectional LSTM, we accurately model the complex dependencies in the data while optimizing computational resources. The proposed synthetic data generator enables the creation of diverse datasets that closely resemble real-world scenarios, facilitating the evaluation of MEC performance and optimizing resource utilization. Through extensive experiments and evaluations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enabling accurate assessments of MEC in 5G networks. Our work contributes to the field by providing a robust methodology for synthetic data generation specifically tailored for MEC evaluation, addressing the need for resource-efficient evaluation frameworks in the context of emerging technologies.

AB  - Getting access to real medical data for research is notoriously difficult. Even when data exist they are usually incomplete and subject to restrictions due to confidentiality and privacy. Synthetic data (SD) are best replacements for real data but must be verifiably realistic. There is little or no investigation into systematically achieving realism in SD. This work investigates this problem, and contributes the ATEN framework, which incorporates three component approaches: (1) THOTH for synthetic data generation (SDG): (2) RA for characterising realism is SD, and (3) HORUS for validating realism in SD. The framework is found promising after its use in generating the realistic synthetic EHR (RS-EHR) for labour and birth. This framework is significant in guaranteeing realism in SDG projects. Future efforts focus on further validation of ATEN in a controlled multi-stream SDG process.

AB  - In the era of data-driven technologies, the need for diverse and high-quality datasets for training and testing machine learning models has become increasingly critical. In this article, we present a versatile methodology, the Generic Methodology for Constructing Synthetic Data Generation (GeMSyD), which addresses the challenge of synthetic data creation in the context of smart devices. GeMSyD provides a framework that enables the generation of synthetic datasets, aligning them closely with real-world data. To demonstrate the utility of GeMSyD, we instantiate the methodology by constructing a synthetic data generation framework tailored to the domain of event-based data modeling, specifically focusing on user interactions with smart devices. Our framework leverages GeMSyD to create synthetic datasets that faithfully emulate the dynamics of human-device interactions, including the temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we showcase how the synthetic data generated using our framework can serve as a valuable resource for machine learning practitioners. By employing these synthetic datasets, we perform a series of experiments to evaluate the performance of a neural-network-based prediction model in the domain of smart device interaction. Our results underscore the potential of synthetic data in facilitating model development and benchmarking.

AB  - Creation of realistic synthetic behavior-based sensor data is an important aspect of testing machine learning techniques for healthcare applications. Many of the existing approaches for generating synthetic data are often limited in terms of complexity and realism. We introduce SynSys, a machine learning-based synthetic data generation method, to improve upon these limitations. We use this method to generate synthetic time series data that is composed of nested sequences using hidden Markov models and regression models which are initially trained on real datasets. We test our synthetic data generation technique on a real annotated smart home dataset. We use time series distance measures as a baseline to determine how realistic the generated data is compared to real data and demonstrate that SynSys produces more realistic data in terms of distance compared to random data generation, data from another home, and data from another time period. Finally, we apply our synthetic data generation technique to the problem of generating data when only a small amount of ground truth data is available. Using semi-supervised learning we demonstrate that SynSys is able to improve activity recognition accuracy compared to using the small amount of real data alone.

AB  - Histopathology involves the analysis of microscopic tissue images for diagnosing and studying the progress of diseases, such as cancers. Recently, Artificial Intelligence algorithms reached encouraging success in diagnosing diseases related to these medical images. However, research in this area can be hampered by several problems. Indeed, due to the sensitive nature of medical data, it is challenging to access real datasets, making it impossible to train Deep Learning models. Moreover, real datasets often contain biases or imbalances that hinder the generalization of the results on new unseen data. Variational Autoencoders are a popular class of probabilistic generative models that enable consistent training and a useful latent representation of the original input. However, there are theoretical and practical obstacles that hinder their generative potential. Here, we consider different approaches to address the challenges of synthetic data generation of histopathology images and discuss the potential impact in improving the performance of diagnosis models.

AB  - Many self-managing relational database management systems (RDBMS) need to programmatically generate synthetic data to train machine learning models. This paper proposes the concept of shadow database and a framework to derive shadow database from production database that matches distribution properties of source data. Moreover, we have designed and implemented an embedded synthetic data generation tool that takes data distribution profile as input and generates a shadow database according to histograms of source data. The distribution profile is passed into the tool either through an export-import mechanism or as a JSON string. The shadow database can scale to be larger or smaller than the original database and serve as a testbed to train learning models. Unlike most other data generation tools, our tool is implemented as SQL procedures that can be embedded in the underlying RDBMS.

Releasing a synthetic data may be a solution for the problem of private data release. In this paper, we consider a generative adversarial networks (GAN)-based synthetic data generation. Furthermore, we perform extensive experiments to evaluate the data utility and risk of re-identification of our GAN-based solution.

AB  - This paper investigates synthetic data generation methods and their evaluation measures. There have been increasing demands for releasing various types of data to the public for different purposes. At the same time, there are also unavoidable concerns about leaking critical or sensitive information. Many synthetic data gener-ation methods have been proposed over the years in order to address these concerns and implemented in some countries, including Korea. The current study aims to introduce and compare three representative synthetic data generation approaches: Sequential regression, nonparametric Bayesian multiple imputations, and deep generative models. Several evaluation metrics that measure the utility and disclosure risk of synthetic data are also reviewed. We provide empirical comparisons of the three synthetic data generation approaches with respect to various eval-uation measures. The findings of this work will help practitioners to have a better understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of those synthetic data methods.

AB  - The clinical time-series setting poses a unique combination of challenges to data modelling and sharing. Due to the high dimensionality of clinical time series, adequate deidentification to preserve privacy while retaining data utility is difficult to achieve using common de-identification techniques. An innovative approach to this problem is synthetic data generation. From a technical perspective, a good generative model for time-series data should preserve temporal dynamics; new sequences should respect the original relationships between high-dimensional variables across time. From the privacy perspective, the model should prevent patient re-identification. The NeurIPS 2020 Hide-and-Seek Privacy Challenge was a novel two-tracked competition to simultaneously accelerate progress in tackling both problems. In our head-to-head format, participants in the generation track ("hiders") and the patient re-identification track ("seekers") were directly pitted against each other by way of a new, high-quality intensive care time-series dataset: the Amsterda-

AB  - Synthetic data generation research has been progressing at a rapid pace and novel methods are being designed every now and then. Earlier, statistical methods were used to learn the distributions of real data and then sample synthetic data from those distributions. Recent advances in generative models have led to more efficient modeling of complex high-dimensional datasets. Also, privacy concerns have led to the development of robust models with lesser risk of privacy breaches. Firstly, the paper presents a comprehensive survey of existing techniques for tabular data generation and evaluation matrices. Secondly, it elaborates on a comparative analysis of state-of- the-art synthetic data generation techniques, specifically CTGAN and TVAE for small, medium, and large-scale datasets with varying data distributions. It further evaluates the synthetic data using quantitative and qualitative metrics/techniques. Finally, this paper presents the outcomes and also highlights the issues and shortcomings which are still need to be addressed.

AB  - With the development of machine learning and data science, data sharing is very common between companies and research institutes to avoid data scarcity. However, sharing original datasets that contain private information can cause privacy leakage. A reliable solution is to utilize private synthetic datasets which preserve statistical information from original datasets. In this paper, we propose MC-GEN, a privacy-preserving synthetic data generation method under differential privacy guarantee for machine learning classification tasks. MC-GEN applies multi-level clustering and differential private generative model to improve the utility of synthetic data. In the experimental evaluation, we evaluated the effects of parameters and the effectiveness of MC-GEN. The results showed that MC-GEN can achieve significant effectiveness under certain privacy guarantees on multiple classification tasks. Moreover, we compare MC-GEN with three existing methods. The results showed that MC-GEN outperforms other methods in terms of utility. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In several real-world applications (e.g., online advertising, item recommendations, etc.) it may not be possible to release and share the real dataset due to privacy concerns. As a result, synthetic data generation (SDG) has emerged as a promising solution for data sharing. While the main goal of private SDG is to create a dataset that preserves the privacy of individuals contributing to the dataset, the use of synthetic data also creates an opportunity to improve fairness. Since there often exist historical biases in the datasets, using the original real data for training can lead to an unfair model. Using synthetic data, we can attempt to remove such biases from the dataset before releasing the data. In this work, we formalize the definition of fairness in synthetic data generation and provide a general framework to achieve fairness. Then we consider two notions of counterfactual fairness and information filtering fairness and show how our framework can be used for these definitions.

AB  - Acquiring real-world data for computer vision presents challenges such as data scarcity, high costs, and privacy concerns. We introduce SynthDa, an automated approach for usable synthetic data generation (SDG) that empowers users with varying expertise to create diverse synthetic data from existing real-world datasets. It combines pose estimation, synthetic scene creation, and domain randomization to offer data variants. Ease of SDG through SynthDa enables different permutations and combinations of synthetic data that allow users to explore efficacy of various data configurations in relation to their specific AI tasks. Our experiments across multiple existing datasets and models demonstrate the utility of SynthDa in challenging nuances such as the "more data, the better" paradigm; revealing that excessive synthetic data may degrade performance and vice versa. In a pilot user study with 24 participants, we show the perceived usefulness of SynthDa as a promising SDG tool for overcoming challenges related to real-world data acquisition.

AB  - The lack of training samples is an important problem in the field of sign language recognition. This paper presents a method of generating synthetic multi-stream samples so as to enlarge the training set of sign. The mean shift algorithm is able to obtain the directions of maximum increase and decrease in the density function, so it is used to control the direction and the intensity of synthetic data generation. The synthetic data generation proposed in this paper satisfies the need of the synthetic samples, which must include a large amount of effective information of unspecific signers. The proposed method is evaluated under different experimental conditions, such as the generating strategy. the capacity of the model, as well as the intensity and direction of the generating process. The results show that in most cases recognition accuracy is improved; and in some, even greatly improved. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Condition monitoring of machines and powertrain components is an essential part of ensuring reliability and product safety in many industries. The monitored machines and components are often divided into different condition classes as well as classified using machine learning methods. In order to enable classification with machine learning algorithms, the acquisition of a sufficient amount of data from each condition class is essential. In reality, the collection of data for faulty system states turns out to be much more difficult, therefore in many use cases balanced data sets are not available. However, when classifying faulty states, an identical number of data per class is of great importance. This problem can be counteracted with synthetic data generation. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are a suitable approach to generate synthetic data based on real measured data. In most cases of synthetic data generation, different damage cases, e.g. from a transmission, are simulated, but a generation of synthetic data is not performed at different operating conditions. However, different speeds and torques are a reality when monitoring, as the drive systems operate under changing operating conditions. Therefore, in the context of this paper, synthetic data generation at different operating states is investigated in order to implement a condition monitoring system for good and bad system conditions which includes different operating states. So, vibration data is acquired at different operating conditions of a transmission on a drive test rig and relevant features are highlighted using a suitable signal pre-processing method. The features, caused by different operating conditions, can also be generated synthetically by GAN. Therefore, it is possible to achieve a similar classification accuracy by integrating synthetically generated data as with real data, which makes the synthetic data generation a viable solution for extending existing data sets.

AB  - Sharing health data for research purposes across international jurisdictions has been a challenge due to privacy concerns. Two privacy enhancing technologies that can enable such sharing are synthetic data generation (SDG) and federated analysis, but their relative strengths and weaknesses have not been evaluated thus far. In this study we compared SDG with federated analysis to enable such international comparative studies. The objective of the analysis was to assess country-level differences in the role of sex on cardiovascular health (CVH) using a pooled dataset of Canadian and Austrian individuals. The Canadian data was synthesized and sent to the Austrian team for analysis. The utility of the pooled (synthetic Canadian + real Austrian) dataset was evaluated by comparing the regression results from the two approaches. The privacy of the Canadian synthetic data was assessed using a membership disclosure test which showed an F1 score of 0.001, indicating low privacy risk. The outcome variable of interest was CVH, calculated through a modified CANHEART index. The main and interaction effect parameter estimates of the federated and pooled analyses were consistent and directionally the same. It took approximately one month to set up the synthetic data generation platform and generate the synthetic data, whereas it took over 1.5 years to set up the federated analysis system. Synthetic data generation can be an efficient and effective tool for enabling multi-jurisdictional studies while addressing privacy concerns.

AB  - Recommendation systems make predictions chiefly based on users' historical interaction data (e.g., items previously clicked or purchased). There is a risk of privacy leakage when collecting the users' behavior data for building the recommendation model. However, existing privacy-preserving solutions are designed for tackling the privacy issue only during the model training [32] and results collection [40] phases. The problem of privacy leakage still exists when directly sharing the private user interaction data with organizations or releasing them to the public. To address this problem, in this paper, we present a User Privacy Controllable Synthetic Data Generation model (short for UPC-SDG), which generates synthetic interaction data for users based on their privacy preferences. The generation model aims to provide certain privacy guarantees while maximizing the utility of the generated synthetic data at both data level and item level. Specifically, at the data level, we design a selection module that selects those items that contribute less to a user's preferences from the user's interaction data. At the item level, a synthetic data generation module is proposed to generate a synthetic item corresponding to the selected item based on the user's preferences. Furthermore, we also present a privacy-utility trade-off strategy to balance the privacy and utility of the synthetic data. Extensive experiments and ablation studies have been conducted on three publicly accessible datasets to justify our method, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating synthetic data under users' privacy preferences.

AB  - Misinformation has become a major challenge in the era of increasing digital information, requiring the development of effective detection methods. We have investigated a novel approach to Out-Of-Context detection (OOCD) that uses synthetic data generation. We created a dataset specifically designed for OOCD and developed an efficient detector for accurate classification. Our experimental findings validate the use of synthetic data generation and demonstrate its efficacy in addressing the data limitations associated with OOCD. The dataset and detector should serve as valuable resources for future research and the development of robust misinformation detection systems.

AB  - The task of classifying or predicting the activity performed by humans is called human activity recognition. Many existing models aim to solve the problem of activity recognition in this field, but we recognise the lack of real data can have a great impact on the effectiveness of such models. In this paper, we introduce SynDa, a first-of-its-kind streamlined semi-automated pipeline for synthetic data generation built using photorealistic rendering and AI pose estimation, that harvests existing real-life video datasets to create new large-scale datasets. The synthetic data can augment real data to train models robustly and overcome the lack of and associated costs to acquire more real data. Preliminary work indicates that combining real data and synthetic video data generated using this pipeline to train models presents a mAP of 32.35%, while a model trained on real data presented 29.95%.

AB  - Class imbalance problems, where the number of samples in each class is unequal, is prevalent in numerous real world machine learning applications. Traditional methods which are biased toward the majority class are ineffective due to the relative severity of misclassifying rare events. This paper proposes a novel evolutionary cluster-based oversampling ensemble framework, which combines a novel cluster-based synthetic data generation method with an evolutionary algorithm (EA) to create an ensemble. The proposed synthetic data generation method is based on contemporary ideas of identifying oversampling regions using clusters. The novel use of EA serves a twofold purpose of optimizing the parameters of the data generation method while generating diverse examples leveraging on the characteristics of EAs, reducing overall computational cost. The proposed method is evaluated on a set of 40 imbalance datasets obtained from the University of California, Irvine, database, and outperforms current state-of-the-art ensemble algorithms tackling class imbalance problems.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, fast becoming pervasive across a growing variety of application domains, typically involve deep machine learning (ML) models that must be trained on very large volumes of data. As training corpora scale up to unprecedented sizes, it is increasingly unrealistic to assume that they can be thoroughly curated. This state of affairs raises serious privacy concerns because of the risk of leakage of private, secure or otherwise sensitive information. Training ML models with synthetic data naturally promotes data privacy and protection, by virtue of reducing the amount of real data to collect. But synthetic data generation has additional benefits as well, in terms of both training diversity and model deployment. This chapter illustrates such benefits through the analysis of three practical use cases associated with common day-to-day features affecting millions of users. These three case studies illuminate key messages associated with synthetic data generation, including inherent limitations and possible mitigation measures.

AB  - Computer vision (CV)-based safety monitoring has been widely applied at construction sites. However, this method requires large, diverse, and accurately labeled training data, which is difficult or expensive to collect from real-world environments. To address this concern, this paper introduces a synthetic data generation methodology driven by game engines, facilitating the simulation of diverse construction scenarios from varying distances and viewpoints. Subsequently, a CV model is trained on hybrid datasets encompassing both synthetic and real-world data, thereby evaluating its viability for safeguarding construction workers by particularly detecting small-sized personal protective equipment. Through the incorporation of synthetic data, a detection performance enhancement of up to 30.4%p is achieved, an encouraging outcome with substantial potential to impact worker safety. The outcome of this investigation possess the capacity to refine the safety and overall welfare of construction workers, delivering a cost-efficient and streamlined means to train CV models tailored for safety monitoring purposes.

AB  - A dataset with diverse training data is essence of the hand gesture recognition research. Most of the benchmarked datasets are limited in the number of signers and/or the number of each gesture try, which often result in over-fitting and poor generalization. Overcoming this challenge is often achieved by collecting a large number of exemplars for each hand gesture. This process is either expensive or impractical. Recently, synthetic data generation methods have been presented as a more reliable way to extend and enrich datasets. This paper proposes a comparative study of statistical and visual synthetic data generation. The visual synthetic data generation is executed by building synthetic 3D animated models using human figure design software. The experiments illustrate how the recognition accuracy will be changed when both methods used in enlarging the training data. The results show that in both cases recognition accuracy is enhanced, and in most cases, the visual synthetic data enlargement provides better improvement in the quality and diversity of the training data.

AB  - Production environments bring inherent system challenges that are reflected in the high-dimensional production data. The data is often nonstationary, is not available in sufficient size and quality, and is class imbalanced due to the predominance of good parts. Data-driven manufacturing analytics requires data of sufficient quantity and quality. In order to predict quality characteristics, production data is collected across processes in the industrial use case at Bosch Rexroth AG for the purpose of inferring results in hydraulic final inspection using machine learning methods. Since high quality data generation is costly, synthetic data generation methodologies offer a promising alternative to improve prediction models and thus generate safer, more accurate predictions for manufacturing companies. Among the synthetic data generation methodologies used, variational autoencoders compared to generative adversarial networks and synthetic minority oversampling technique methods are best suited to synthesize the feature with highest feature importance from a small sample data set compared to the production data and improve the prediction for the target variable.

AB  - Synthetic data generation (SDG) research has been ongoing for some time with promising results in different application domains, including healthcare, biometrics and energy consumption. The need for a robust SDG solution to capitalise on advances in Big Data and AI technology has never been greater to enable access to useful data while ensuring reasonable privacy protections. This paper presents a systematic review from the last 5 years (2016-2021) to analyse and report on recent approaches in synthetic tabular data generation (STDG) with a focus on the healthcare application context to preserve patient privacy, paying special attention to the contribution of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). In total 34 publications have been retrieved and analysed. A classification of approaches has been proposed and the performance of GAN-based approaches has been extensively analysed. From the systematic review it has been concluded that there is no universal method or metric to evaluate and benchmark the performance of various approaches and that further research is needed to improve the generalisability of GANs to find a model that works optimally across tabular healthcare data.

AB  - Autonomous aircraft are the key enablers of future urban services, such as postal and transportation systems. Digital twins (DTs) are promising cutting-edge technologies that can transform the future transport ecosystem into an autonomous and resilient system. However, since DT is a data-driven solution based on AI, proper data management is essential in implementing DT as a service (DTaaS). One of the challenges in DT development is the availability of real-life data, particularly for training algorithms and verifying the functionality of DT. The current article focuses on data augmentation through synthetic data generation. This approach can facilitate the development of DT in case the developers do not have enough data to train the machine learning (ML) algorithm. The current twinning approach provides a prospective ideal state of the engine used for proactive monitoring of the engine's health as an anomaly detection service. In line with the track of unmanned aircraft vehicles (UAVs) for urban air mobility in smart city applications, this paper focuses specifically on the common hybrid turbo-shaft in drones/helicopters. However, there is a significant gap in real-life similar synthetic data generation in the UAV domain literature. Therefore, rolling linear regression and Kalman filter algorithms were implemented on noise-added data, which simulate the data measured from the engine in a real-life operational life cycle. For both thermal and hybrid models, the corresponding DT model has shown high efficiency in noise filtration and a certain amount of predictions with a lower error rate on all engine parameters except the engine torque.

AB  - Synthetic data consists of artificially generated data. When data are scarce, or of poor quality, synthetic data can be used, for example, to improve the performance of machine learning models. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a state-of-the-art deep generative models that can generate novel synthetic samples that follow the underlying data distribution of the original dataset. Reviews on synthetic data generation and on GANs have already been written. However, none in the relevant literature, to the best of our knowledge, has explicitly combined these two topics. This survey aims to fill this gap and provide useful material to new researchers in this field. That is, we aim to provide a survey that combines synthetic data generation and GANs, and that can act as a good and strong starting point for new researchers in the field, so that they have a general overview of the key contributions and useful references. We have conducted a review of the state-of-the-art by querying four major databases: Web of Sciences (WoS), Scopus, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library. This allowed us to gain insights into the most relevant authors, the most relevant scientific journals in the area, the most cited papers, the most significant research areas, the most important institutions, and the most relevant GAN architectures. GANs were thoroughly reviewed, as well as their most common training problems, their most important breakthroughs, and a focus on GAN architectures for tabular data. Further, the main algorithms for generating synthetic data, their applications and our thoughts on these methods are also expressed. Finally, we reviewed the main techniques for evaluating the quality of synthetic data (especially tabular data) and provided a schematic overview of the information presented in this paper.

AB  - AI model development for synthetic data generation to improve Machine Learning (ML) methodologies is an integral part of research in Computer Science and is currently being transferred to related medical fields, such as Systems Medicine and Medical Informatics. In general, the idea of personalized decision-making support based on patient data has driven the motivation of researchers in the medical domain for more than a decade, but the overall sparsity and scarcity of data are still major limitations. This is in contrast to currently applied technology that allows us to generate and analyze patient data in diverse forms, such as tabular data on health records, medical images, genomics data, or even audio and video. One solution arising to overcome these data limitations in relation to medical records is the synthetic generation of tabular data based on real world data. Consequently, ML-assisted decision-support can be interpreted more conveniently, using more relevant patient data at hand. At a methodological level, several state-of-the-art ML algorithms generate and derive decisions from such data. However, there remain key issues that hinder a broad practical implementation in real-life clinical settings. In this review, we will give for the first time insights towards current perspectives and potential impacts of using synthetic data generation in palliative care screening because it is a challenging prime example of highly individualized, sparsely available patient information. Taken together, the reader will obtain initial starting points and suitable solutions relevant for generating and using synthetic data for ML-based screenings in palliative care and beyond.

AB  - One of the main challenges in underwater automatic target recognition is in the data scarcity of underwater sonar imagery. This challenge arises especially in data-driven approaches because of the limited training dataset and unknown environmental conditions before the mission. Transfer learning and synthetic data generation have been suggested as effective methods to overcome this challenge. However, the efficiency and effectiveness of synthetic data generation methods have been limited due to the difficulty from implementing complex acoustic imaging processes and data-driven model's poor performance under domain shifts. In this paper, we present a novel approach to address this challenge by utilizing cycle-generative adversarial networks (GAN) to generate synthetic sonar images to enhance the effectiveness of the training data set. Our method simplifies the process of synthetic data generation by leveraging cycle-GAN, which is a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for image-to-image translation using unpaired dataset. The cycle-GAN based generation model transfers camera images of ship and plane into realistic synthetic sonar images. Then, these generated synthetic images are used to augment the training data set for the classification model. In this work, the effectiveness of this approach is demonstrate through a series of experiments, showing improvements in classification accuracy. One advantage of the proposed approach is in the simplification of the synthetic data generation process while improving classification accuracy. Another advantage is that the ship and plane sonar image generation model is trained solely on seabed sonar images, which are relatively easy to obtain. This approach has the potential to greatly benefit the field of underwater sonar image classification by providing a more efficient solution for addressing data scarcity.

AB  - The generation of synthetic data can be used for anonymization, regularization, oversampling, semi-supervised learning, self-supervised learning, and several other tasks. Such broad potential motivated the development of new algorithms, specialized in data generation for specific data formats and Machine Learning (ML) tasks. However, one of the most common data formats used in industrial applications, tabular data, is generally overlooked; Literature analyses are scarce, state-of-the-art methods are spread across domains or ML tasks and there is little to no distinction among the main types of mechanism underlying synthetic data generation algorithms. In this paper, we analyze tabular and latent space synthetic data generation algorithms. Specifically, we propose a unified taxonomy as an extension and generalization of previous taxonomies, review 70 generation algorithms across six ML problems, distinguish the main generation mechanisms identified into six categories, describe each type of generation mechanism, discuss metrics to evaluate the quality of synthetic data and provide recommendations for future research. We expect this study to assist researchers and practitioners identify relevant gaps in the literature and design better and more informed practices with synthetic data.

AB  - Training a stroke gesture classifier by using the state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network method requires a large sample size to achieve good performance. This becomes a serious problem when users want to add new gestures to the system because adding so many samples is time-consuming and expensive. In this paper, we propose an iterative synthetic data generation method to solve this problem. The method takes in one user-input template gesture which is modeled by Bezier curve and can generate thousands of samples for training. We propose two different modeling approaches so the method can be applied to both mono and multi-stroke gestures. By applying perturbation to the control points, we can obtain enough samples for training. The generation process is carried out in an iterative way, so the variability in different categories of stroke gestures can be balanced. The variability is measured by the dynamic time wrapping method. The proposed method is tested on our own dataset and two published datasets. Our method outperforms methods with fixed generation process and reaches high recognition accuracy.

TI  - PreFair: Privately Generating Justifiably Fair Synthetic Data
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE VLDB ENDOWMENT
LA  - English
CP  - 49th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases (VLDB)
AB  - When a database is protected by Differential Privacy (DP), its usability is limited in scope. In this scenario, generating a synthetic version of the data that mimics the properties of the private data allows users to perform any operation on the synthetic data, while maintaining the privacy of the original data. Therefore, multiple works have been devoted to devising systems for DP synthetic data generation. However, such systems may preserve or even magnify properties of the data that make it unfair, rendering the synthetic data unfit for use. In this work, we present PreFair, a system that allows for DP fair synthetic data generation. PreFair extends the state-of-the-art DP data generation mechanisms by incorporating a causal fairness criterion that ensures fair synthetic data. We adapt the notion of justifiable fairness to fit the synthetic data generation scenario. We further study the problem of generating DP fair synthetic data, showing its intractability and designing algorithms that are optimal under certain assumptions. We also provide an extensive experimental evaluation, showing that PreFair generates synthetic data that is significantly fairer than the data generated by leading DP data generation mechanisms, while remaining faithful to the private data.

AB  - Few-shot learning addresses the challenge of learning how to address novel tasks given not just limited supervision but limited data as well. An attractive solution is synthetic data generation. However, most such methods are overly sophisticated, focusing on high-quality, realistic data in the input space. It is unclear whether adapting them to the few-shot regime and using them for the downstream task of classification is the right approach. Previous works on synthetic data generation for few-shot classification focus on exploiting complex models, e.g. a Wasserstein GAN with multiple regularizers or a network that transfers latent diversities from known to novel classes.
   We follow a different approach and investigate how a simple and straightforward synthetic data generation method can be used effectively. We make two contributions, namely we show that: (1) using a simple loss function is more than enough for training a feature generator in the few-shot setting; and (2) learning to generate tensor features instead of vector features is superior. Extensive experiments on miniImagenet, CUB and CIFAR-FS datasets show that our method sets a new state of the art, outperforming more sophisticated few-shot data augmentation methods.

AB  - We show that supervised neural information retrieval (IR) models are prone to learning sparse attention patterns over passage tokens, which can result in key phrases including named entities receiving low attention weights, eventually leading to model under-performance. Using a novel targeted synthetic data generation method that identifies poorly attended entities and conditions the generation episodes on those, we teach neural IR to attend more uniformly and robustly to all entities in a given passage. On two public IR benchmarks, we empirically show that the proposed method(1) helps improve both the model's attention patterns and retrieval performance, including in zero-shot settings.

AB  - A key challenge in further improving infrared (IR) sensor capabilities is the development of efficient data pre-processing algorithms. This paper addresses this challenge by providing a mathematical model and synthetic data generation framework for an uncooled IR sensor. The developed model is capable of generating synthetic data for the design of data pre-processing algorithms of uncooled IR sensors. The mathematical model accounts for the physical characteristics of the focal plane array, bolometer readout, optics and the environment. The framework permits the sensor simulation with a range of sensor configurations, pixel defectiveness, non-uniformity and noise parameters.

KW  - DATA GENERATION
AB  - Synthetic data has been widely applied in the real world recently. One typical example is the creation of synthetic data for privacy concerned datasets. In this scenario, synthetic data substitute the real data which contains the privacy information, and is used to public testing for machine learning models. Another typical example is the unbalance data over-sampling which the synthetic data is generated in the region of minority samples to balance the positive and negative ratio when training the machine learning models. In this study, we concentrate on the first example, and introduce (a) the Howso engine, and (b) our proposed random projection based synthetic data generation framework. We evaluate these two algorithms on the aspects of privacy preservation and accuracy, and compare them to the two state-of-the-art synthetic data generation algorithms DataSynthesizer and Synthetic Data Vault. We show that the synthetic data generated by Howso engine has good privacy and accuracy, which results in the best overall score. On the other hand, our proposed random projection based framework can generate synthetic data with highest accuracy score, and has the fastest scalability.

TI  - MMM and MMMSynth: Clustering of heterogeneous tabular data, and synthetic data generation
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - We provide new algorithms for two tasks relating to heterogeneous tabular datasets: clustering, and synthetic data generation. Tabular datasets typically consist of heterogeneous data types (numerical, ordinal, categorical) in columns, but may also have hidden cluster structure in their rows: for example, they may be drawn from heterogeneous (geographical, socioeconomic, methodological) sources, such that the outcome variable they describe (such as the presence of a disease) may depend not only on the other variables but on the cluster context. Moreover, sharing of biomedical data is often hindered by patient confidentiality laws, and there is current interest in algorithms to generate synthetic tabular data from real data, for example via deep learning. We demonstrate a novel EM-based clustering algorithm, MMM ("Madras Mixture Model"), that outperforms standard algorithms in determining clusters in synthetic heterogeneous data, and recovers structure in real data. Based on this, we demonstrate a synthetic tabular data generation algorithm, MMMsynth, that pre-clusters the input data, and generates cluster-wise synthetic data assuming cluster-specific data distributions for the input columns. We benchmark this algorithm by testing the performance of standard ML algorithms when they are trained on synthetic data and tested on real published datasets. Our synthetic data generation algorithm outperforms other literature tabular-data generators, and approaches the performance of training purely with real data.

AB  - Object Detection (OD) has proven to be a significant computer vision method in extracting localized class information and has multiple applications in the industry. Although many of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) OD models perform well on medium and large sized objects, they seem to under perform on small objects. In most of the industrial use cases, it is difficult to collect and annotate data for small objects, as it is time-consuming and prone to human errors. Additionally, those datasets are likely to be unbalanced and often result in an inefficient model convergence. To tackle this challenge, this study presents a novel approach that injects additional data points to improve the performance of the OD models. Using synthetic data generation, the difficulties in data collection and annotations for small object data points can be minimized and to create a dataset with balanced distribution. This paper discusses the effects of a simple proportional class-balancing technique, to enable better anchor matching of the OD models. A comparison was carried out on the performances of the SOTA OD models: YOLOv5, YOLOv7 and SSD, for combinations of real and synthetic datasets within an industrial use case.

AB  - The paper is devoted to the problem of generating artificial datasets for data envelopment analysis (DEA), which can be used for testing DEA models and methods. In particular, the papers that applied DEA to big data often used synthetic data generation to obtain large-scale datasets because real datasets of large size, available in the public domain, are extremely rare. This paper proposes the algorithm which takes as input some real dataset and complements it by artificial efficient and inefficient units. The generation process extends the efficient part of the frontier by inserting artificial efficient units, keeping the original efficient frontier unchanged. For this purpose, the algorithm uses the assurance region method and consistently relaxes weight restrictions during the iterations. This approach produces synthetic datasets that are closer to real ones, compared to other algorithms that generate data from scratch. The proposed algorithm is applied to a pair of small real-life datasets. As a result, the datasets were expanded to 50K units. Computational experiments show that artificially generated DMUs preserve isotonicity and do not increase the collinearity of the original data as a whole.

KW  - in silico trials
KW  - synthetic data
KW  - medical devices
AB  - In silico trial methods promise to improve the path to market for both medicines and medical devices, targeting the development of products, reducing reliance on animal trials, and providing adjunct evidence to bolster regulatory submissions. In silico trials are only as good as the simulated data which underpins them, consequently, often the most difficult challenge when creating robust in silico models is the generation of simulated measurements or even virtual patients that are representative of real measurements and patients. This article digests the current state of the art for generating synthetic patient data outside the context of in silico trials and outlines potential synergies to unlock the potential of in silico trials using virtual populations, by exploiting synthetic patient data to model effects on a more diverse and representative population. Synthetic data could be defined as artificial data that mimic the properties and relationships in real data. Recent advances in synthetic data generation methodologies have allowed for the generation of high-fidelity synthetic data that are both statistically and clinically, indistinguishable from real patient data. Other experimental work has demonstrated that synthetic data generation methods can be used for selective sample boosting of underrepresented groups. This article will provide a brief outline of synthetic data generation approaches and discuss how evaluation frameworks developed to assess synthetic data fidelity and utility could be adapted to evaluate the similarity of virtual patients used for in silico trials, to real patients. The article will then discuss outstanding challenges and areas for further research that would advance both synthetic data generation methods and in silico trial methods. Finally, the article will also provide a perspective on what evidence will be required to facilitate wider acceptance of in silico trials for regulatory evaluation of medicines and medical devices, including implications for post marketing safety surveillance.

AB  - Indonesia is a country with a tropical climate that has high rainfall rates and is supported by the uncertainty of weather and climate conditions. With the uncertainty of weather and climate as well as flood events, minimal predictive information on flooding, and the lack of availability of data on the causes of flooding, a comparison of synthetic data generation from the minimal data available from BMKG with synthetic data generation from Kaggle online platform data in the form of temperature and humidity data, rainfall, and wind speed from BMKG and annual rain data from Kaggle was analyzed. This research aims to obtain the results of data comparison analysis of synthetic data generation from different datasets with the benchmark of classification system results using K -Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and accuracy evaluation with Confusion Matrix. The research process uses climate data from the BMKG DI Yogyakarta Climatology Station within 20 months, the Geophysical Station within 12 months, and Kerala data with a range of 1901-2018. Synthetic data generation is done using the Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Network (CTGAN) model. CTGAN produces quite good data in terms of distribution and data differences if the original data is large and the synthetic data generated is small. The KNN classification system on the BMKG data experienced overfitting, as indicated by the accuracy value in the evaluation increasing in the range of 85- 94% and the validation decreasing in the range of 89%-65%. This is because there is no uniqueness in the data and too little original data made into synthetics, which affects the difficulty of the classification system in identifying data that is quite different in distance and data values generated by CTGAN. In Kerala, the accuracy value on evaluation is in the range of 92-95%, and validation is in the range of 0.7-0.83%, with Classifier k1 being the most optimal system.

AB  - A vine copula model is a flexible high-dimensional dependence model which uses only bivariate building blocks. However, the number of possible configurations of a vine copula grows exponentially as the number of variables increases, making model selection a major challenge in development. In this work, we formulate a vine structure learning problem with both vector and reinforcement learning representation. We use neural network to find the embeddings for the best possible vine model and generate a structure. Throughout experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, we show that our proposed approach fits the data better in terms of log-likelihood. Moreover, we demonstrate that the model is able to generate high-quality samples in a variety of applications, making it a good candidate for synthetic data generation.

This paper presents a novel approach of generating synthetic Photoplethysmogram (PPG) data using statistical explosion. Synthetic data is subsequently used to classify Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) using a two stage cascaded classifier. Proposed classifier along with synthetic data removes class bias and provides better accuracy compared to state of art.

Synthetic data generation might be useful to run research-based simulations and also create mobility encounter models. Our approach in this paper is to generate a larger dataset by using a given dataset which includes the clusters of people. Based on the cluster information, we created a framework. Using this framework, we can generate a similar dataset that is statistically similar to the input dataset. We have compared the statistical results of our approach with the real dataset and an encounter mobility model generation technique in the literature. The results showed that the created datasets have similar statistical structure with the given dataset.

TI  - SemGen-Towards a Semantic Data Generator for Benchmarking Duplicate Detectors
T2  - DATABASE SYSTEMS FOR ADVANCED APPLICATIONS, DASFAA 2011
LA  - English
CP  - 16th International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications (DASFAA)
AB  - Benchmarking the quality of duplicate detection methods requires comprehensive knowledge on duplicate pairs in addition to sufficient size and variability of test data sets. While extending real-world data sets with artificially created data is promising, current approaches to such synthetic data generation, however, work solely on a quantitative level, which entails that duplicate semantics are only implicitly represented, leading to only insufficiently configurable variability.
   In this paper we propose SemGen, a semantics-driven approach to synthetic data generation. SemGen first diversifies real-world objects on a qualitative level, before in a second step quantitative values are generated. To demonstrate the applicability of SemGen, we propose how to define duplicate semantics for the domain of road traffic management. A discussion of lessons learned concludes the paper.

AB  - The search for new alloys with improved properties is never ending with infinite combinations and amounts of alloying elements in the alloy. Advancements in machine learning have made navigating this enormous search space feasible. However, training the machine learning models and tuning their hyper-parameters to make accurate predictions can be time-consuming and often require high-performance computing resources. Furthermore, the quality of the predictions depend on the availability of sufficient training data. Here, we present a generic approach to accelerate alloy discovery by coupling high throughput CALPHAD calculations, synthetic data generation, and data mining. As a demonstration of the approach, we design super bainitic steels that form bainite at 200 degrees C in lower transformation times.

T2  - 2017 IEEE SYMPOSIUM SERIES ON COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE (SSCI)

CP  - IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (IEEE SSCI)
AB  - Discovering pattern from imbalanced data plays an important role in numerous applications, such as health service, cyber security, and financial engineering. However, the imbalanced data greatly compromise the performance of most learning algorithms. Recently, various synthetic sampling methods have been proposed to balance the dataset. Although these methods have achieved great success in many datasets, they are less effective for high-dimensional data, such as the image. In this paper, we propose a variational autoencoder (VAE) based synthetic data generation method for imbalanced learning. VAE can produce new samples which are similar to those in the original dataset, but not exactly the same. We evaluate and compare our proposed method with the traditional synthetic sampling methods on various datasets under five evaluation metrics. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI  - Post-processing Private Synthetic Data for Improving Utility on Selected Measures
T2  - ADVANCES IN NEURAL INFORMATION PROCESSING SYSTEMS 36 (NEURIPS 2023)

CP  - 37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS)
AB  - Existing private synthetic data generation algorithms are agnostic to downstream tasks. However, end users may have specific requirements that the synthetic data must satisfy. Failure to meet these requirements could significantly reduce the utility of the data for downstream use. We introduce a post-processing technique that improves the utility of the synthetic data with respect to measures selected by the end user, while preserving strong privacy guarantees and dataset quality. Our technique involves resampling from the synthetic data to filter out samples that do not meet the selected utility measures, using an efficient stochastic first-order algorithm to find optimal resampling weights. Through comprehensive numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our approach consistently improves the utility of synthetic data across multiple benchmark datasets and state-of-the-art synthetic data generation algorithms.

AB  - Spoken keyword spotting is the task of identifying a keyword in an audio stream and is widely used in smart devices at the edge to activate voice assistants and perform hands-free tasks. The task is daunting as there is a need to achieve high accuracy while at the same time ensuring that such systems continue to run efficiently on low power and possibly limited computational capabilities devices. This work presents AraSpot for Arabic keyword spotting trained on 40 Arabic keywords, using different online data augmentation and introducing ConformerGRU model architecture. Finally, we further improve the performance of the model by training a text-to-speech model for synthetic data generation. AraSpot achieved a state-of-the-art 99.59% result outperforming previous approaches.(1)

AB  - The imbalance of classes in real-world datasets poses a major challenge in machine learning and classification, and traditional synthetic data generation methods often fail to address this problem effectively. A major limitation of these methods is that they tend to separate the process of generating synthetic samples from the training process, resulting in synthetic data that lack the necessary informative characteristics for proper model training. We present a new synthetic data generation method that addresses this issue by combining adversarial sample generation with a triplet loss method. This approach focuses on increasing the diversity in the minority class while preserving the integrity of the decision boundary. Furthermore, we show that reducing triplet loss is equivalent to maximizing the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve under specific conditions, providing a theoretical basis for the effectiveness of our method. In addition, we present a model training approach to further improve the generalization of the model to small classes by providing a diverse set of synthetic samples optimized using our proposed loss function. We evaluated our method on several imbalanced benchmark tasks and compared it to state-of-the-art techniques, demonstrating that our method can deliver even better performance, making it an effective solution to the class imbalance problem.

AB  - This research confronts the persistent challenge of data scarcity in medical machine learning by introducing a pioneering methodology that harnesses the capabilities of Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT). In response to the limitations posed by a dearth of labeled medical data, our approach involves the synthetic generation of comprehensive patient discharge messages, setting a new standard in the field with GPT autonomously generating 20 fields. Through a meticulous review of the existing literature, we systematically explore GPT's aptitude for synthetic data generation and feature extraction, providing a robust foundation for subsequent phases of the research. The empirical demonstration showcases the transformative potential of our proposed solution, presenting over 70 patient discharge messages with synthetically generated fields, including severity and chances of hospital re-admission with justification. Moreover, the data had been deployed in a mobile solution where regression algorithms autonomously identified the correlated factors for ascertaining the severity of patients' conditions. This study not only establishes a novel and comprehensive methodology but also contributes significantly to medical machine learning, presenting the most extensive patient discharge summaries reported in the literature. The results underscore the efficacy of GPT in overcoming data scarcity challenges and pave the way for future research to refine and expand the application of GPT in diverse medical contexts.

AB  - Grammatical Error Detection and Correction (GEC) tools have proven useful for native speakers and second language learners. Developing such tools requires a large amount of parallel, annotated data, which is unavailable for most languages. Synthetic data generation is a common practice to overcome the scarcity of such data. However, it is not straightforward for morphologically rich languages like Turkish due to complex writing rules that require phonological, morphological, and syntactic information. In this work, we present a flexible and extensible synthetic data generation pipeline for Turkish covering more than 20 expert-curated grammar and spelling rules (a.k.a., writing rules) implemented through complex transformation functions. Using this pipeline, we derive 130,000 high-quality parallel sentences from professionally edited articles. Additionally, we create a more realistic test set by manually annotating a set of movie reviews. We implement three baselines formulating the task as i) neural machine translation, ii) sequence tagging, and iii) prefix tuning with a pretrained decoder-only model, achieving strong results. Furthermore, we perform exhaustive experiments on out-of-domain datasets to gain insights on the transferability and robustness of the proposed approaches. Our results suggest that our corpus, GECTurk, is high-quality and allows knowledge transfer for the out-of-domain setting. To encourage further research on Turkish GEC, we release our datasets, baseline models, and the synthetic data generation pipeline at https://github.com/GGLAB-KU/gecturk.

AB  - Lecture videos have become a great resource for students and teachers. These videos are a vast information source, but most search engines only index them by their audio. To make these videos searchable by handwritten content, it is important to develop accurate methods for analyzing such content at scale. However, training deep neural networks to their full potential requires large-scale lecture video datasets. In this paper, we use synthetic data generation to improve binarization of lecture videos. We also use it to semantically segment pixels into background, speaker, text, mathematical expressions, and graphics. Our method for synthetic data generation renders content from multiple handwritten and typeset datasets, and blends it into real images using random tight layouts and the location of the people. In addition, we also propose a mixed data approach that trains networks on two detection tasks at once: person and text. Both binarization and semantic segmentation are carried out using fully convolutional neural networks with a typical encoder-decoder architecture and residual connections. Our experiments show that pretraining on both synthetic and mixed data leads to better performance than training with real data alone. While final results are promising, more work will be needed to reduce the domain shift between synthetic and real data. Our code and data are publicly available.

AB  - This study is devoted to the automatization of the image masks' construction of largesized agricultural objects in precision farming tasks for training neural network methods crop's nitrogen status analysis using georeferenced images. The scientific direction is extremely relevant because it allows to automate and replace the manual process of data labeling, significantly reducing the cost of preparing training samples. In the paper, four synthetic data generation methods are proposed for training neural networks aimed at UAV image segmentation by the level of crop nitrogen supply on an agricultural field. In particular, the paper gives a description of synthetic data generation algorithms based on nitrogen covering with lines, parabolas, and areas. Experiments were carried out to test and evaluate the quality of these algorithms using eight modern image segmentation methods: two classical machine learning methods (Random Forest and XGBoost), four convolutional neural network methods based on U -Net architecture, and two transformers (TransUnet and UnetR). The results showed that two algorithms based on areas gave the best accuracy for convolutional neural networks and transformers - 98-100 %. Classical machine learning methods showed very low values for all quality metrics - 27-44 %.

AB  - Deep learning-based methods have shown excellent potential on object detection and pose estimation with vast amounts of training data to achieve good performance. Obtaining enough comprehensive manual labeling training data is a time-consuming and error-prone task in industrial scenes, and most current time-saving synthetic data generation methods require detailed high-quality CAD models. Instead, we introduce an image-to-image translation based synthetic data generation approach, which requires only untextured CAD models and a small number of real images. The proposed approach starts with edge maps extracted by mesh model projection. And each edge map is provided with realistic appearance learned from real images through image-to-image translation to achieve patch-level realism, and then superimposed on randomly selected backgrounds with a simple Cut-and-Paste strategy. Experiments on our custom dataset and T-LESS dataset show that our synthetic data is competitive with uncomprehensive real data and gives a considerable improvement when compared to the same degree of model rendering images. In addition, the proposed approach allows for extensibility to accommodate new parts with similar texture and structure. And it shows the potential to train image translation model on only one single object and synthesize data for multiples in one take.

AB  - Differential privacy synthetic data is one of the most effective methods for privacy preserving data release. However, the existing schemes still suffer from high computational complexity and inability to directly handle values of large domain size when synthesizing high-dimensional data. To mitigate this gap, we propose synthetic data generation for differential privacy using maximum weight matching (DPMWM), a method for automatically synthesizing tabular data in high-dimensional large domain size via differential privacy. Specifically, DPMWM uses differential privacy maximum weight matching for low-dimensional marginal selection and then automatically synthesizes multiple records based on the filtered marginals. The experimental results show that DPMWM outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy for counting queries and classification tasks on datasets with larger domain size.

AB  - Problems related to data privacy are studied in the areas of privacy preserving data mining (PPDM) and statistical disclosure control (SDC). Their goal is to avoid the disclosure of sensitive or proprietary information to third parties. In this paper a new synthetic data generation method is proposed and the information loss and disclosure risk are measured. The method is based on fuzzy techniques. Informally, a fuzzy c-regression method is applied to the original data set and synthetic data is released with an appropriate information loss and disclosure risk depending on c. As other data protection methods do, our synthetic data generation procedure allows third parties to do some statistical computations with a limited risk of disclosure. The trade-off between data utility and data safety of our proposed method will be assessed.

AB  - The Gaussianity assumption has been consistently criticized as a main limitation of the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) despite its efficiency in computational modeling. In this paper, we propose a new approach that expands the model capacity (i.e., expressive power of distributional family) without sacrificing the computational advantages of the VAE framework. Our VAE model's decoder is composed of an infinite mixture of asymmetric Laplace distribution, which possesses general distribution fitting capabilities for continuous variables. Our model is represented by a special form of a nonparametric M-estimator for estimating general quantile functions, and we theoretically establish the relevance between the proposed model and quantile estimation. We apply the proposed model to synthetic data generation, and particularly, our model demonstrates superiority in easily adjusting the level of data privacy.

AB  - Currently, the best object detection results are achieved by supervised deep learning methods, however, these methods depend on annotated training data. With the synthetic data generation approach, we intend to mimic the real data characteristics and diversify the dataset by a systematic rendering of highly realistic synthetic pictures. We systematically explore how different combinations and portions of real and synthetic datasets affect object detectors performance. The developed synthetic data generation framework shows promising results in deep learning-based object detection tasks and can supplement real data when the variety of real training data is insufficient. However, when synthetic data ratio increases over real data ratio, a decrease in average precision can be observed, which has the most affect on 0.75-0.95 IoU threshold range.

AB  - Featured Application This study's findings hold significant implications for enhancing data privacy and utility in healthcare analytics. By evaluating synthetic data generation methods like CTGAN, TVAE, CopulaGAN and Copula across diverse medical datasets containing sensitive patient information, such as genetic profiles and medical histories, the research aims to improve the development of predictive models without compromising patient privacy.Abstract The generation of synthetic data holds significant promise for augmenting limited datasets while avoiding privacy issues, facilitating research, and enhancing machine learning models' robustness. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) stand out as promising tools, employing two neural networks-generator and discriminator-to produce synthetic data that mirrors real data distributions. This study evaluates GAN variants (CTGAN, CopulaGAN), a variational autoencoder, and copulas on diverse real datasets of different complexity encompassing numerical and categorical attributes. The results highlight CTGAN's sensitivity to training parameters and TVAE's robustness across datasets. Scalability challenges persist, with GANs demanding substantial computational resources. TVAE stands out for its high utility across all datasets, even for high-dimensional data, though it incurs higher privacy risks, which is indicative of the curse of dimensionality. While no single model universally excels, understanding the trade-offs and leveraging model strengths can significantly enhance synthetic data generation (SDG). Future research should focus on adaptive learning mechanisms, scalability enhancements, and standardized evaluation metrics to advance SDG methods effectively. Addressing these challenges will foster broader adoption and application of synthetic data.

AB  - Noncommunicable diseases are among the most significant health threats in our society, being cardiovascular diseases (CVD) the most prevalent. Because of the severity and prevalence of these illnesses, early detection and prevention are critical for reducing the worldwide health and economic burden. Though machine learning (ML) methods usually outperform conventional approaches in many domains, class imbalance can hinder the learning process. Oversampling techniques on the minority classes can help to overcome this issue. In particular, in this paper we apply oversampling methods to categorical data, aiming to improve the identification of risk factors associated with CVD. To conduct this study, questionnaire data (categorical) obtained by the Norwegian Centre for E-health Research associated with healthy and CVD patients are considered. The goal of this work is two-fold. Firstly, evaluating the influence of combining oversampling techniques and linear/nonlinear supervised ML methods in binary tasks. Secondly, identifying the most relevant features for predicting healthy and CVD cases. Experimental results show that oversampling and FS techniques help to improve CVD prediction. Specifically, the use of Generative Adversarial Networks and linear models usually achieve the best performance (area under the curve of 67%), outperforming other oversampling techniques. Synthetic data generation has proved to be beneficial for both identifying risk factors and creating models with reasonable generalization capability in the CVD prediction.

AB  - We introduce the DP-auto-GAN framework for synthetic data generation, which combines the low dimensional representation of autoencoders with the flexibility of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). This framework can be used to take in raw sensitive data and privately train a model for generating synthetic data that will satisfy similar statistical properties as the original data. This learned model can generate an arbitrary amount of synthetic data, which can then be freely shared due to the post-processing guarantee of differential privacy. Our framework is applicable to unlabeled mixed-type data, that may include binary, categorical, and real-valued data. We implement this framework on both binary data (MIMIC-III) and mixed-type data (ADULT), and compare its performance with existing private algorithms on metrics in unsupervised settings. We also introduce a new quantitative metric able to detect diversity, or lack thereof, of synthetic data.

AB  - Computer vision, enabled by artificial intelligence and deep learning, has a nearly limitless number of possible applications, military and civilian. Object detection methods are a particularly notable type of computer vision, with broad usefulness in a variety of systems, such as autonomous vehicles, robotics, and security. Development of effective object detection methods faces many challenges; one such challenge of significance is a lack of good labeled data for the target domain, as hand labeled data is time-consuming and expensive to produce. Synthetic data generation seeks to solve this problem by programmatically generating both training data and labels simultaneously, allowing for the creation of arbitrarily large training datasets. However, synthetic data has several drawbacks - generating realistic imagery is challenging and computationally expensive, and models trained with synthetic data frequently suffer in accuracy when applied to real test data.
   In our research, we use model explainability techniques to connect model predictions back to the model training data, in order to identify the most important features that need to be represented accurately in synthetic training data. Influence functions score model training samples based on how influential each sample was to a particular prediction, by approximating the effect of retraining the model after leaving each individual training sample out of the training set. In this work, we seek to extend influence functions to identify the most valuable features in real and synthetic training data for use in improving our synthetic data generation tools.

AB  - Privacy poses a significant obstacle to the progress of learning analytics (LA), presenting challenges like inadequate anonymization and data misuse that current solutions struggle to address. Synthetic data emerges as a potential remedy, offering robust privacy protection. However, prior LA research on synthetic data lacks thorough evaluation, essential for assessing the delicate balance between privacy and data utility. Synthetic data must not only enhance privacy but also remain practical for data analytics. Moreover, diverse LA scenarios come with varying privacy and utility needs, making the selection of an appropriate synthetic data approach a pressing challenge. To address these gaps, we propose a comprehensive evaluation of synthetic data, which encompasses three dimensions of synthetic data quality, namely resemblance, utility, and privacy. We apply this evaluation to three distinct LA datasets, using three different synthetic data generation methods. Our results show that synthetic data can maintain similar utility (i.e., predictive performance) as real data, while preserving privacy. Furthermore, considering different privacy and data utility requirements in different LA scenarios, we make customized recommendations for synthetic data generation. This paper not only presents a comprehensive evaluation of synthetic data but also illustrates its potential in mitigating privacy concerns within the field of LA, thus contributing to a wider application of synthetic data in LA and promoting a better practice for open science.

AB  - In this study, we introduce a new synthetic data generation procedure for augmentation of histopathology image data. This is an extension to our previous research in which we proved the possibility to apply deep learning models for morphological analysis of tumor cells, trained on synthetic data only. The medical problem considered is related to the Ki-67 protein proliferation index calculation. We focused on the problem of cell counting in cell conglomerates, which are considered as structures composed of overlapping tumor cells. The lack of large and standardized data sets is a critical problem in medical image classification. Classical augmentation procedures are not sufficient. Therefore, in this research, we expanded our previous augmentation approach for histopathology images and we proved the possibility to apply it for a cell-counting problem.

CP  - Interspeech Conference
AB  - Natural Language Understanding (NLU) systems such as chat-bots or virtual assistants have seen a significant rise in popularity in recent times, thanks to availability of large volumes of user data. However, typical user data collected for training such models may suffer from sampling biases due to a variety of factors. In this paper, we study the impact of bias in the training data for intent classification task, a core component of NLU systems. We experiment with three kinds of data bias settings: (i) random down-sampling, (ii) class-dependent bias, and (iii) class-independent bias injection. For each setting, we report the loss in model performance and survey strategies to mitigate the loss from two families of methods: (i) semi-supervised learning (SSL), and (ii) synthetic data generation. Overall, we find that while both methods perform well with random down-sampling, synthetic data generation out-performs SSL when only biased training data is available.

AB  - This paper contributes to the field of deep generative learning applied to solar photovoltaic (PV) synthetic data generation problems by exploring Deep Generative Model (DGM) that combines Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), i.e., VAEGAN. We build upon knowledge in the area of deep learning to incorporate our Hybrid Deep Neural Network (HDNN), combining convolutional and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers at the encoding level for producing robust latent representations and subsequently high-quality synthetic PV data samples. The major advantage of these approaches is that it allows the DGMs to perform better feature extraction as well as to capture the historical trends in data effectively. The simulations on actual data acquired from a real PV system demonstrate the effectiveness of the DGMs to produce high-quality samples for multiple seasons of the year.

AB  - Creation of a synthetic dataset that faithfully represents the data distribution and simultaneously preserves privacy is a major research challenge. Many space partitioning based approaches have emerged in recent years for answering statistical queries in a differentially private manner. However, for synthetic data generation problem, recent research has been mainly focused on deep generative models. In contrast, we exploit space partitioning techniques together with noise perturbation and thus achieve intuitive and transparent algorithms. We propose both data independent and data dependent algorithms for epsilon-differentially private synthetic data generation whose kernel density resembles that of the real dataset. Additionally, we provide theoretical results on the utility-privacy trade-offs and show how our data dependent approach overcomes the curse of dimensionality and leads to a scalable algorithm. We show empirical utility improvements over the prior work, and discuss performance of our algorithm on a downstream classification task on a real dataset.

AB  - Sharing microdata is a very important part of the present day world, but when they contain sensitive information, privacy to individuals needs to be guaranteed before release of data. One idea is to study the distributional properties of a data-set and generate synthetic data which has similar properties but unlike the original data comes with a privacy guarantee. In this review paper, we describe in detail, some advanced privacy guarantees that needs to be checked before release of such information. Also, we discuss some utility metrics to measure the remaining utility of released data. Very few mechanisms have been developed to ensure utility to synthetic data, provided a very strong privacy guarantee is maintained. We discuss some existing methodologies on privacy preserving synthetic data generation and discuss a privacy utility tradeoff problem.

AB  - Synthetic data generation can be applied to Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to obtain synthetic versions that do not compromise patients' privacy. However, the proliferation of synthetic data generation techniques has led to the introduction of a wide variety of methods for evaluating the quality of generated data. This makes the task of evaluating generated data from different models challenging as there is no consensus on the methods used. Hence the need for standard ways of evaluating the generated data. In addition, the available methods do not assess whether dependencies between different variables are maintained in the synthetic data. Furthermore, synthetic time series EHRs (patient encounters) are not well investigated, as the available methods do not consider the temporality of patient encounters. In this work, we present an overview of evaluation methods and propose an evaluation framework to guide the evaluation of synthetic EHRs.

AB  - Synthetic health data have the potential to mitigate privacy concerns in supporting biomedical research and healthcare applications. Modern approaches for data generation continue to evolve and demonstrate remarkable potential. Yet there is a lack of a systematic assessment framework to benchmark methods as they emerge and determine which methods are most appropriate for which use cases. In this work, we introduce a systematic benchmarking framework to appraise key characteristics with respect to utility and privacy metrics. We apply the framework to evaluate synthetic data generation methods for electronic health records data from two large academic medical centers with respect to several use cases. The results illustrate that there is a utility-privacy tradeoff for sharing synthetic health data and further indicate that no method is unequivocally the best on all criteria in each use case, which makes it evident why synthetic data generation methods need to be assessed in context.

AB  - While there were already some privacy challenges organized in the domain of data sanitization, they have mainly focused on the defense side of the problem. To favor the organization of successful challenges focusing on attacks, we introduce the Snake framework that is designed to facilitate the organization of challenges dedicated to attacking existing data sanitization mechanisms. In particular, it enables to easily automate the redundant tasks that are inherent to any such challenge and exhibits the following salient features: genericity with respect to attacks, ease of use and extensibility. We propose to demonstrate the main features of the Snake framework through a specific instantiation focusing on membership inference attacks over differentially-private synthetic data generation schemes. This instance of the Snake framework is currently being used for supporting a challenge co-located with APVP 2023 (the French workshop on the protection of privacy).

AB  - Despite several works that succeed in generating synthetic data with differential privacy (DP) guarantees, they are inadequate for generating high-quality synthetic data when the input data has missing values. In this work, we formalize the problems of DP synthetic data with missing values and propose three effective adaptive strategies that significantly improve the utility of the synthetic data on four real-world datasets with different types and levels of missing data and privacy requirements. We also identify the relationship between privacy impact for the complete ground truth data and incomplete data for these DP synthetic data generation algorithms. We model the missing mechanisms as a sampling process to obtain tighter upper bounds for the privacy guarantees to the ground truth data. Overall, this study contributes to a better understanding of the challenges and opportunities for using private synthetic data generation algorithms in the presence of missing data.

TI  - Multiple Imputation and Synthetic Data Generation with NPBayesImputeCat
T2  - R JOURNAL
LA  - English
AB  - In many contexts, missing data and disclosure control are ubiquitous and challenging issues. In particular, at statistical agencies, the respondent-level data they collect from surveys and censuses can suffer from high rates of missingness. Furthermore, agencies are obliged to protect respondents' privacy when publishing the collected data for public use. The NPBayesImputeCat R package, introduced in this paper, provides routines to i) create multiple imputations for missing data and ii) create synthetic data for statistical disclosure control, for multivariate categorical data, with or without structural zeros. We describe the Dirichlet process mixture of products of the multinomial distributions model used in the package and illustrate various uses of the package using data samples from the American Community Survey (ACS). We also compare results of the missing data imputation to the mice R package and those of the synthetic data generation to the synthpop R package.

In contrast to most previous approaches, we aim to generate data of a sensor exclusively from data available at sensors in different body locations. Particularly, we evaluate existing approaches proposed in the literature for their suitability in this scenario. In this paper, we focus on the prediction of acceleration data and generate machine learning models based on generative adversarial networks and trained using correlated data from sensors in different body positions to generate synthetic sensor data that can replace the missing data from a sensor in a specific body position. The accuracy of the generated synthetic data is evaluated using a classification model based on a convolutional neural network for human activity recognition.

This possibility was used to develop a quality prediction system using supervised machine learning methods in form of time series classification models to predict ovality in radial-axial ring rolling. Different preprocessing steps and model implementations have been used to improve quality prediction. A semi-supervised approach is used to improve the prediction and analyze, to what extend it can improve current research in machine learning for quality prediciton. Moreover, first research steps are taken towards a synthetic data generation within the radial-axial ring rolling domain using generative adversarial networks.

In this work, we explore the usage of automatic paraphrasing models such as GPT-2 and CVAE to augment template phrases for task-oriented dialogue systems while preserving the slots. Additionally, we systematically analyze how far manually annotated training data can be reduced. We extrinsically evaluate the performance of a natural language understanding system on augmented data on various levels of data availability, reducing manually written templates by up to 75% while preserving the same level of accuracy. We further point out that the typical NLG quality metrics such as BLEU or utterance similarity are not suitable to assess the intrinsic quality of NLU paraphrases, and that public task-oriented NLU datasets such as ATIS and SNIPS have severe limitations.

AB  - We propose a strategic approach to generate synthetic data in order to improve machine learning algorithms such as Deep Neural Networks (DNN). Utilization of synthetic data has shown promising results yet there are no specific rules or recipes on how to generate and cook synthetic data. We propose imitation training as a guideline of synthetic data generation to add more underrepresented entities and balance the data distribution for DNN to handle corner cases and resolve long tail problems. The proposed imitation training has a circular process with three main steps: First, the existing system is evaluated and failure cases such as false positive and false negative detections are sorted out; Secondly, synthetic data imitating such failure cases is created with domain randomization; Thirdly, we train a network with the existing data and the newly added synthetic data; We repeat these three steps until the evaluation metric converges.

AB  - Recent progress in artificial intelligence and machine learning has led to the growth of research in every aspect of life including the health care domain. However, privacy risks and legislations hinder the availability of patient data to researchers. Synthetic data (SD) has been regarded as a privacy-safe alternative to real data and has lately been employed in many research and academic endeavors. This growing body of research needs to be consolidated for the researchers and practitioners to gain a quick and fruitful comprehension of the state of the art in synthetic data generation in health care. The purpose of this study is to collate and synthesize the current state of synthetic data generation following a narrative review of 70 peer-reviewed studies discussing privacy-preserving synthetic medical data generation techniques. The literature shows the effectiveness of synthetic datasets for different applications in research, academics, and testing according to existing statistical and task-based utility metrics. However, the focus on longitudinal synthetic data seems deficient. Moreover, a unified metric for generic quality assessment of synthetic data is lacking. The results of this review will serve as a quick reference guide for the researchers and practitioners in the healthcare domain to select a suitable synthetic data strategy for their application based on its strengths and weaknesses and pave the path for further research and development in healthcare.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Acoustic sensing has been widely exploited for the early detection of harmful situations in urban environments: in particular, several siren identification algorithms based on deep neural networks have been developed and have proven robust to the noisy and non-stationary urban acoustic scene. Although high classification accuracy can be achieved when training and evaluating on the same dataset, the cross-dataset performance of such models remains unexplored. To build robust models that generalize well to unseen data, large datasets that capture the diversity of the target sounds are needed, whose collection is generally expensive and time consuming. To overcome this limitation, in this work we investigate synthetic data generation techniques for training siren identification models. To obtain siren source signals, we either collect from public sources a small set of stationary, recorded siren sounds, or generate them synthetically. We then simulate source motion, acoustic propagation and Doppler effect, and finally combine the resulting signal with background noise. This way, we build two synthetic datasets used to train three different convolutional neural networks, then tested on real-world datasets unseen during training. We show that the proposed training strategy based on the use of recorded source signals and synthetic acoustic propagation performs best. In particular, this method leads to models that exhibit a better generalization ability, as compared to training and evaluating in a cross-dataset setting. Moreover, the proposed method loosens the data collection requirement and is entirely built using publicly available resources.

AB  - Synthetic data generation for tabular data unlike computer vision, is an emerging challenge. When tabular data needs to be synthesized, it either faces a small dataset problem or violates privacy if the data contains sensitive information. When the data is small, any data-driven modeling leads to biased decision making. On the other hand, deep learning models that use small dataset for training are limited. Tabular data also faces a myriad of challenges, such as mixed data types, fidelity, mode collapse, etc. To eradicate small dataset problems and increase the deep learning capabilities on small data, a new generative method, GenerativeMTD, is proposed in this research. The method generates fake data by using pseudo-real data as input during the training. Pseudo-real data serves the purpose of training the deep learning model with large samples when the real dataset size is small. The pseudo-real data is generated from the real data through k-nearest neighbor mega-trend diffusion. This pseudo-real data is then translated into synthetic data that is similar and realistic to the real data. The method outperforms some of the state-of-the-art methodologies that exist in tabular data generation. The proposed method also generates quality synthetic data for the benchmark datasets in terms of pairwise correlation differences. In addition, the method surpasses the benchmark models in terms of the distance-based privacy metrics: distance to the closest record and nearest neighbor distance ratio.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - A Synthetic Data Generation Framework for Grounded Dialogues

CP  - 61st Annual Meeting of the the Association-for-Computational-Linguistics (ACL)
AB  - Training grounded response generation models often requires a large collection of grounded dialogues. However, it is costly to build such dialogues. In this paper, we present a synthetic data generation framework (SynDG) for grounded dialogues. The generation process utilizes large pre-trained language models and freely available knowledge data (e.g., Wikipedia pages, persona profiles, etc.). The key idea of designing SynDG is to consider dialogue flow and coherence in the generation process. Specifically, given knowledge data, we first heuristically determine a dialogue flow, which is a series of knowledge pieces. Then, we employ T5 to incrementally turn the dialogue flow into a dialogue. To ensure coherence of both the dialogue flow and the synthetic dialogue, we design a two-level filtering strategy, at the flow-level and the utterance-level respectively. Experiments on two public benchmarks show that the synthetic grounded dialogue data produced by our framework is able to significantly boost model performance in both full training data and low-resource scenarios.

AB  - We introduce a One-Shot Learning system where a robot effectively learns how to manipulate objects by relying solely on the object's name, a single image, and a visual example of a person picking it up. Once the robot has mastered picking up a new object, an audio command is all that is needed to prompt it to perform the action. Our approach heavily depends on synthetic data generation, which is crucial for training various detection and regression models. Additionally, we introduce a novel combined regression model called Cross-Validation Regression with Z-Score (CVR-ZS), which improves the robot's grasp accuracy. The system also features a classifier that uses a cutting-edge text-encoding technique, allowing for flexible user prompts for object retrieval. The complete system includes a text encoder and classifier, an object detector, and the CVR-ZS regressor. This setup has been validated with a Niryo Ned robot.

AB  - Secondary risks may arise as a result of implementing a risk response plan and may substantially impact the achievement of project objectives. Despite their importance, there is a scarcity of research on scheduling resources to effectively manage these risks. This study presents a pioneering mixed-integer optimization model and a tailored meta-heuristic solution algorithm, specifically designed to determine optimal primary and secondary risk response strategies. To validate our model, we introduce a synthetic data generation framework capable of generating appropriate scenarios based on specific metrics. We apply the model and algorithm to a full factorial numerical experiment constructed using the synthetic data generation algorithm. This allows us to derive managerial insights on secondary risks and the impact that secondary risk responses may have on project objectives. The outcomes of this study provide valuable insights for project managers to better manage both primary and secondary risks.

AB  - Testing in production-like test environments is an essential part of quality assurance processes in many industries. Provisioning of such test environments, for information-intensive services, involves setting up databases that are rich-enough to enable simulating a wide variety of user scenarios. While production data is perhaps the gold-standard here, many organizations, particularly within the public sectors, are not allowed to use production data for testing purposes due to privacy concerns. The alternatives are to use anonymized data, or synthetically generated data. In this paper, we elaborate on these alternatives and compare them in an industrial context. Further we focus on synthetic data generation and investigate the use of recurrent neural networks for this purpose. In our preliminary experiments, we were able to generate representative and highly accurate data using a recurrent neural network. These results open new research questions that we discuss here, and plan to investigate in our future research.

AB  - Accurate hand segmentation is important for human segmentation. However, in videos, hand regions usually have serious motion blur, which reduces segmentation performance obviously. To solve this problem, we propose an automatic matting network to deal with motion-blurred hands. Then we combine the hand alpha mattes provided by matting network and the human segmentation results provided by segmentation network to generate our final human soft segmentation results. In addition, to train the matting network, we need a huge amount of motion-blurred hand images and their groundtruth alpha mattes. However these images are very difficult to obtain. To solve this problem, we propose an efficient semi-automatic synthetic data generation method and generate 36186 synthetic motion-blurred hand images and their alpha mattes. Experiments on synthetic images and real videos show that our method achieves state-of-art matting performance and successfully solve the problem of bad hand segmentation caused by serious motion blur.

AB  - Synthetic data generation is generally used in performance evaluation and function tests in data-intensive applications, as well as in various areas of data analytics, such as privacy-preserving data publishing (PPDP) and statistical disclosure limit/control. A significant amount of research has been conducted on tools and languages for data generation. However, existing tools and languages have been developed for specific purposes and are unsuitable for other domains. In this article, we propose a regular expression-based data generation language (DGL) for flexible big data generation. To achieve a general-purpose and powerful DGL, we enhanced the standard regular expressions to support the data domain, type/format inference, sequence and random generation, probability distributions, and resource reference. To efficiently implement the proposed language, we propose caching techniques for both the intermediate and database queries. We evaluated the proposed improvement experimentally.

T2  - 2023 IEEE/CVF CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER VISION AND PATTERN RECOGNITION (CVPR)
LA  - English
CP  - IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)
AB  - This paper firstly presents old photo modernization using multiple references by performing stylization and enhancement in a unified manner. In order to modernize old photos, we propose a novel multi-reference-based old photo modernization (MROPM) framework consisting of a network MROPM-Net and a novel synthetic data generation scheme. MROPM-Net stylizes old photos using multiple references via photorealistic style transfer (PST) and further enhances the results to produce modern-looking images. Meanwhile, the synthetic data generation scheme trains the network to effectively utilize multiple references to perform modernization. To evaluate the performance, we propose a new old photos benchmark dataset (CHD) consisting of diverse natural indoor and outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method outperforms other baselines in performing modernization on real old photos, even though no old photos were used during training. Moreover, our method can appropriately select styles from multiple references for each semantic region in the old photo to further improve the modernization performance.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a framework for 3D human pose estimation with a single 360 degrees camera mounted on the user's wrist. Perceiving a 3D human pose with such a simple setting has remarkable potential for various applications (e.g., daily-living activity monitoring, motion analysis for sports enhancement). However, no existing work has tackled this task due to the difficulty of estimating a human pose from a single camera image in which only a part of the human body is captured and the lack of training data. Therefore, we propose an effective method for translating wrist-mounted 360 degrees camera images into 3D human poses. We also propose silhouettebased synthetic data generation dedicated to this task, which enables us to bridge the domain gap between real-world data and synthetic data. We achieved higher estimation accuracy quantitatively and qualitatively compared with other baseline methods.

AB  - Recently, due to commercial success of data mining tools, there has been much attention to extracting hidden information from large databases to predict security problems and terrorist threats. The security applications are somewhat more complicated than commercial applications due to (i) lack of sufficient specific knowledge on what to look for, (ii) R&D labs developing these tools are not able to easily obtain sensitive information due to security, privacy or cost issues. Tools developed for security applications require substantially more testing and revisions in order to prevent costly errors. This paper describes a platform for the generation of realistic synthetic data that can facilitate the development and testing of data mining tools. The original applications for this platform were people information and credit card transaction data sets. In this paper, we introduce a new shipping container application that can support the testing of data mining tools developed for port security.

AB  - Bayesian Network (BN) modeling is a prominent and increasingly popular computational systems biology method. It aims to construct network graphs from the large heterogeneous biological datasets that reflect the underlying biological relationships. Currently, a variety of strategies exist for evaluating BN methodology performance, ranging from utilizing artificial benchmark datasets and models, to specialized biological benchmark datasets, to simulation studies that generate synthetic data from predefined network models. The last is arguably the most comprehensive approach; however, existing implementations often rely on explicit and implicit assumptions that may be unrealistic in a typical biological data analysis scenario, or are poorly equipped for automated arbitrary model generation. In this study, we develop a purely probabilistic simulation framework that addresses the demands of statistically sound simulations studies in an unbiased fashion. Additionally, we expand on our current understanding of the theoretical notions of causality and dependence / conditional independence in BNs and the Markov Blankets within.

AB  - Deep convolutional networks have dominated advances in object detection and grasp-position estimation using computer vision. The data-collection process for these networks is, however, time-consuming and expensive. We propose an automatic data-collection method for object detection and grasp-position estimation using mobile robots and invisible markers. Our method offers clear advantages over manual data annotation and synthetic data generation in terms of time consumption, cost, consistency, and similarity to real-world data. We compared data generated with our method against synthetically generated data to show how it can affect the robustness of the deep learning model when inferred under real-world conditions. We also conducted a comparison between our method and manual data-collection and synthetic-data-generation methods and demonstrated how our method could be used for data collection of asymmetric objects and key-point estimation tasks.

AB  - Infrastructure scene understanding from image data aids diverse applications in construction and maintenance. Recently, deep learning models have been employed to extract information regarding infrastructure from visual data. The performance of these models depends significantly on the volume of training data. However, preparing the training data is time-consuming and laborious, as it entails labeling numerous images. To address this issue, this paper proposes a method for generating high-quality synthetic data that includes the automatic annotation of infrastructure scenes. The method consists of three steps: 1) translating building information model (BIM) images into real-world images, 2) automatically labeling them using the spatial information contained in the BIM to generate various synthetic datasets, and 3) splicing the selected synthetic datasets together to form the final synthetic dataset. The Mask R-CNN models trained with building and bridge synthetic data achieved average precisions of 71.6% and 84.9%, respectively.

AB  - Synthetic data generation is critical in machine and deep learning research to overcome the shortage of samples or dataset sizes. Various algorithms, including the generative adversarial network and autoencoder models, have been applied to generate artificial datasets in previous studies. In this study, we propose a synthetic data generation framework for a tabular dataset collected from cognitive psychology behavioral experiments based on deep learning algorithms. Tabular datasets for the Stroop task were used to develop our framework. On account of the relatively small sample size (N=102) of the dataset used in our study, we used a pre-trained generative adversarial network model to complement the size of the dataset. Furthermore, we proposed and applied five evaluation methods with statistical tests (overlapped sample test, constraint reflection test, correlation reflection test, distribution distance test, and feature distance test) to validate generation performance based on internal levels of table structure (instance level, feature level, and whole-set level evaluations). The proposed framework with a fine-tuned generative adversarial network algorithm was compared with a random generation method to verify generation performance, including the representation of the statistical characteristics of the original datasets. We found that the generated datasets from the proposed framework exhibited more similar statistical characteristics with the original dataset than the randomly generated datasets based on five evaluation methods. The results of this study provide not only generation algorithms for cognitive psychological datasets with tabular type but also a solution to the sample size issue for researchers.

AB  - A synthetic dataset is a data object that is generated programmatically, and it may be valuable to creating a single dataset from multiple sources when direct collection is difficult or costly. Although it is a fundamental step for many data science tasks, an efficient and standard framework is absent. In this paper, we study a specific synthetic data generation task called downscaling, a procedure to infer high-resolution, harder-to-collect information (e.g., individual level records) from many low-resolution, easy-to-collect sources, and propose a multi-stage framework called SYNC (Synthetic Data Generation via Gaussian Copula). For given low-resolution datasets, the central idea of SYNC is to fit Gaussian copula models to each of the low-resolution datasets in order to correctly capture dependencies and marginal distributions, and then sample from the fitted models to obtain the desired high-resolution subsets. Predictive models are then used to merge sampled subsets into one, and finally, sampled datasets are scaled according to low-resolution marginal constraints. We make four key contributions in this work: 1) propose a novel framework for generating individual level data from aggregated data sources by combining state-of-the-art machine learning and statistical techniques, 2) perform simulation studies to validate SYNC's performance as a synthetic data generation algorithm, 3) demonstrate its value as a feature engineering tool, as well as an alternative to data collection in situations where gathering is difficult through two real-world datasets, 4) release an easy-to-use framework implementation for reproducibility and scalability at the production level that easily incorporates new data.

AB  - Currently, the generation of synthetic data has become very fashionable, either due to the need to create data in certain specific contexts or to study unknown scenarios among other reasons. Additionally, synthetic data is a critical component in training machine learning models in the presence of little data. This work proposes a synthetic data generation system architecture to allow synthetic data generation to be fully automated. SDGS is based on the variational autoencoders learning technique, and has three main capabilities. The first is related to the ability to extract data samples from multiple sources using the linked data paradigm. The second is linked to the ability to merge data sets to increase the amount of information that can be provided to the VAE-based synthetic data generator. The last one is related to having a feature engineering layer to create new features by generating or extracting information from the dataset and then selecting the features that provide the best information for the VAE model. A case study is described in detail to show the new functionalities of the SDGS, such as dataset extraction from different sources using LD, dataset merging using pivots, and the application of different feature engineering methods. Finally, two metrics are used to evaluate the quality of the generated datasets in different case studies. The first one is the accuracy to analyze the performance of the models generated with the new SDGS functionalities, obtaining results above 90%. The second one is the two-sample Hotelling's T-squared test to determine the quality of the synthetic data generated by the system, obtaining synthetic datasets very similar to the original datasets.

AB  - Background Generating synthetic patient data is crucial for medical research, but common approaches build up on black-box models which do not allow for expert verification or intervention. We propose a highly available method which enables synthetic data generation from real patient records in a privacy preserving and compliant fashion, is interpretable and allows for expert intervention.Methods Our approach ties together two established tools in medical informatics, namely OMOP as a data standard for electronic health records and Synthea as a data synthetization method. For this study, data pipelines were built which extract data from OMOP, convert them into time series format, learn temporal rules by 2 statistical algorithms (Markov chain, TARM) and 3 algorithms of causal discovery (DYNOTEARS, J-PCMCI+, LiNGAM) and map the outputs into Synthea graphs. The graphs are evaluated quantitatively by their individual and relative complexity and qualitatively by medical experts.Results The algorithms were found to learn qualitatively and quantitatively different graph representations. Whereas the Markov chain results in extremely large graphs, TARM, DYNOTEARS, and J-PCMCI+ were found to reduce the data dimension during learning. The MultiGroupDirect LiNGAM algorithm was found to not be applicable to the problem statement at hand.Conclusion Only TARM and DYNOTEARS are practical algorithms for real-world data in this use case. As causal discovery is a method to debias purely statistical relationships, the gradient-based causal discovery algorithm DYNOTEARS was found to be most suitable.

AB  - We propose a bottom-up approach for the instance segmentation of cables (commonly referred in the literature as deformable linear objects). While the state of the art instance segmentation techniques propose a bounding box and perform foreground segmentation within each proposed bounding box, we adopt a bottom-up approach as cables can span a considerable part of the image or even the entire image, and therefore, cannot be well localized in a bounding box. In this paper, we show that several operations in the top-down instance segmentation approaches are only applicable for certain classes (i.e., compact objects) such as cars but they are a poor approximation for objects with highly overlapping bounding boxes such as cables. In particular, the non-maximum suppression and RoIPool/RoIAlign operations limit the generalizability of proposal-based instance segmentation methods to such datasets. Furthermore, we introduce a synthetic data generation technique that can also be applied to other popular public datasets such as COCO, Pascal VOC, and Cityscapes.

AB  - Deep learning models for identification and subsequent mitigation of tokamak plasma disruption have recently shown great promise for reliable predictions for machines other than the one on which it has been trained. The performance of such artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) models strongly depends on the training data. Considering the sparse availability of universal high quality data underscores the requirement for synthetic data for the training of the AI/ML models. Synthetic data generation methods reported in the current literature have limitations in terms of quantity, diversity and preserving the temporal dynamics of the experimental seed data (SD). The article presents generative adversarial networks based procedure capable enough to generate unlimited device-independent temporal evolution of tokamak plasma current. The synthetic data improves with the employment of the classified SD while retaining the characteristics of the original data. The procedure offers a substantial volume of synthetic data with a very impressive diversity, thereby ensuring the requirements for successful AI/ML model training.

AB  - The development and testing of autonomous systems require sufficient meaningful data. However, generating suitable scenario data is a challenging task. In particular, it raises the question of how to narrow down what kind of data should be considered meaningful. Autonomous systems are characterized by their ability to cope with uncertain situations, i.e. complex and unknown environmental conditions. Due to this openness, the definition of training and test scenarios cannot be easily specified. Not all relevant influences can be sufficiently specified with requirements in advance, especially for unknown scenarios and corner cases, and therefore the "right" data, balancing quality and efficiency, is hard to generate. This article discusses the challenges of automated generation of 3D scenario data. We present a training and testing loop that provides a way to generate synthetic camera and Lidar data using 3D simulated environments. Those can be automatically varied and modified to support a closed-loop system for deriving and generating datasets that can be used for continuous development and testing of autonomous systems.

AB  - Offline handwritten mathematical expression recognition is a challenging optical character recognition (OCR) task due to various ambiguities of handwritten symbols and complicated two-dimensional structures. Recent work in this area usually constructs deeper and deeper neural networks trained with end-to-end approaches to improve the performance. However, the higher the complexity of the network, the more the computing resources and time required. To improve the performance without more computing requirements, we concentrate on the training data and the training strategy in this paper. We propose a data augmentation method which can generate synthetic samples with new LaTeX notations by only using the official training data of CROHME. Moreover, we propose a novel training strategy called Shuffled Multi-Round Training (SMRT) to regularize the model. With the generated data and the shuffled multi-round training strategy, we achieve the state-of-the-art result in expression accuracy, i.e., 59.74% and 61.57% on CROHME 2014 and 2016, respectively, by using attention-based encoder-decoder models for offline handwritten mathematical expression recognition.

AB  - There is increasing evidence that coronary artery wall shear stress (WSS) measurement provides useful prognostic information that allows prediction of adverse cardiovascular events. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has been extensively used in research to measure vessel physiology and examine the role of the local haemodynamic forces on the evolution of atherosclerosis. Nonetheless, CFD modelling remains computationally expensive and time-consuming, making its direct use in clinical practice inconvenient. A number of studies have investigated the use of deep learning (DL) approaches for fast WSS prediction. However, in these reports, patient data were limited and most of them used synthetic data generation methods for developing the training set. In this paper, we implement 2 approaches for synthetic data generation and combine their output with real patient data in order to train a DL model with a U-net architecture for prediction of WSS in the coronary arteries. The model achieved 6.03% Normalised Mean Absolute Error (NMAE) with inference taking only 0.35 s; making this solution time-efficient and clinically relevant.

AB  - People's location data are continuously tracked from various devices and sensors, enabling an ongoing analysis of sensitive information that can violate people's privacy and reveal confidential information. Synthetic data have been used to generate representative location sequences yet to maintain the users' privacy. Nonetheless, the privacy-accuracy tradeoff between these two measures has not been addressed systematically. In this article, we analyze the use of different synthetic data generation models for long location sequences, including extended short-term memory networks (LSTMs), Markov Chains (MC), and variable-order Markov models (VMMs). We employ different performance measures, such as data similarity and privacy, and discuss the inherent tradeoff. Furthermore, we introduce other measurements to quantify each of these measures. Based on the anonymous data of 300 thousand cellular-phone users, our work offers a road map for developing policies for synthetic data generation processes. We propose a framework for building data generation models and evaluating their effectiveness regarding those accuracy and privacy measures.

AB  - Knowledge distillation is the technique of compressing a larger neural network, known as the teacher, into a smaller neural network, known as the student, while still trying to maintain the performance of the larger neural network as much as possible. Existing methods of knowledge distillation are mostly applicable for classification tasks. Many of them also require access to the data used to train the teacher model. To address the problem of knowledge distillation for regression tasks in the absence of original training data, the existing method uses a generator model trained adversarially against the student model to generate synthetic data to train the student model. In this study, we propose a new synthetic data generation strategy that directly optimizes for a large but bounded difference between the student and teacher model. Our results on benchmark experiments demonstrate that the proposed strategy allows the student model to learn better and emulate the performance of the teacher model more closely.

AB  - Outstanding performance has been observed in a number of real-world applications such as speech processing and image classification using deep learning models. However, developing these kinds of models in sensitive domains such as healthcare usually necessitates dealing with a specific level of privacy challenges which provide unique concerns. For managing such privacy concerns, a practical method might involve generating feasible synthetic data that not only provides acceptable data quality but also helps to improve the efficiency of the model. Synthetic Data Generation (SDG) innately includes Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) that have drawn significant interest in this field as a result of their achievement in various other research areas. In the study, a framework safeguarding privacy, which employs R ' enyi Differential Privacy along with Generative Adversarial Networks and a Variational Autoencoder (RDP-VAEGAN), is introduced. This approach is evaluated and contrasted with other top-tier models having identical privacy constraints, utilizing both unsupervised and supervised methods on two medical datasets that are publicly accessible.

AB  - In the context of neural passage retrieval, we study three promising techniques: synthetic data generation, negative sampling and fusion. We systematically investigate how these techniques contribute to the performance of the retrieval system and how they complement each other. We propose a multi-stage framework comprising of pre-training with synthetic data, fine-tuning with labeled data and negative sampling at both stages. We study six negative sampling strategies and apply them to the fine-tuning stage and, as a noteworthy novelty, to the synthetic data that we use for pre-training. Also, we explore fusion methods that combine negatives from different strategies. We evaluate our system using two passage retrieval tasks for open-domain QA and using MS MARCO. Our experiments show that augmenting the negative contrast in both stages is effective to improve passage retrieval accuracy and, importantly, they also show that synthetic data generation and negative sampling have additive benefits. Moreover, using fusion of different kinds allows us to reach performance that establishs a new state-of-the-art level in two of the tasks we evaluated.

AB  - Synthetic data generation has been proposed as a flexible alternative to more traditional statistical disclosure control (SDC) methods for minimising disclosure risk. However, a barrier to the use of synthetic data is the uncertainty about the reliability and validity of the results that are derived from these data. Surprisingly, there has been a relative dearth of research on how to measure the utility of synthetic data. Utility measures developed to date have been either information theoretic abstractions or somewhat arbitrary collations of statistics, and replication of previously published results has been rare. In this paper, we adopt a methodology previously used by Purdam and Elliot (2007), in which they replicated published analyses using disclosure-controlled versions of the same microdata used in said analyses and then evaluated the impact of disclosure control on the analytic outcomes. We utilise the same studies as Purdam and Elliot, based on the 1991 UK Samples of Anonymised Records, to facilitate comparisons of synthetic data utility between different utility metrics.

AB  - Object recognition and object pose estimation in robotic grasping continue to be significant challenges, since building a labelled dataset can be time consuming and financially costly in terms of data collection and annotation. In this work, we propose a synthetic data generation method that minimizes human intervention and makes downstream image segmentation algorithms more robust by combining a generated synthetic dataset with a smaller real-world dataset (hybrid dataset). Annotation experiments show that the proposed synthetic scene generation can diminish labelling time dramatically. RGB image segmentation is trained with hybrid dataset and combined with depth information to produce pixel-to-point correspondence of individual segmented objects. The object to grasp is then determined by the confidence score of the segmentation algorithm. Pick-and-place experiments demonstrate that segmentation trained on our hybrid dataset (98.9%, 70%) outperforms the real dataset and a publicly available dataset by (6.7%, 18.8%) and (2.8%, 10%) in terms of labelling and grasping success rate, respectively.

AB  - To alleviate the burden of manual image annotation, we propose an automatic learning method to enable object detection. This method mainly consists of the following three aspects: (1) a novel synthetic data generation strategy, which can automatically generate large-scale synthetic data with bounding-box annotations using only semantic concepts of target categories; (2) self-training paradigm combined with synthetic data generation strategy, which mines more information from the unannotated real data through iterative training to improve the performance of the object detector; (3) a simple and effective pseudo box filtering method, which can purify the quality of pseudo boxes during training. Without using any annotations (i.e., image-level annotations and bounding-box annotations) from the PASCAL VOC dataset, our proposed method can obtain 59.3% and 55.1% mAP on PASCAL VOC 2007 and PASCAL VOC 2012, respectively. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several datasets, includ-ing CUB-200-2011, FGVC Aircraft, Stanford Cars, Bird-Aircraft-Car-Dog, and CBCL StreetScenes.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been highly successful for generating realistic synthetic data. In healthcare, synthetic data generation can be helpful for producing annotated data and improving data-driven research without worries on data privacy. However, electronic health records (EHRs) are noisy, incomplete and complex, and existing work on EHR data is mainly devoted to generating discrete elements such as diagnosis codes and medications or frequent laboratory values. In this work, we propose SMOOTH-GAN, a novel approach for generating reliable EHR data such as laboratory values and medications given diagnosis codes. SMOOTH-GAN takes advantage of a conditional GAN architecture with WGAN-GP loss, and is able to learn transitions between disease stages with high flexibility over data customization. Our experiments demonstrate the model's effectiveness in terms of both statistical similarity and accuracy on machine learning based prediction. To further demonstrate the usage of our model, we apply counterfactual reasoning and generate data with occurrence of multiple diseases, which can provide unique datasets for artificial intelligence driven healthcare research.

AB  - Recent work on dense optical flow has shown significant progress, primarily in a supervised learning manner requiring a large amount of labeled data. Due to the expensiveness of obtaining large-scale real-world data, computer graphics are typically leveraged for constructing datasets. However, there is a common belief that synthetic-to-real domain gaps limit generalization to real scenes. In this paper, we show that the required characteristics in an optical flow dataset are rather simple and present a simpler synthetic data generation method that achieves a certain level of realism with compositions of elementary operations. With 2D motion-based datasets, we systematically analyze the simplest yet critical factors for generating synthetic datasets. Furthermore, we propose a novel method of utilizing occlusion masks in a supervised method and observe that suppressing gradients on occluded regions serves as a powerful initial state in the curriculum learning sense. The RAFT network initially trained on our dataset outperforms the original RAFT on the two most challenging online benchmarks, MPI Sintel and KITTI 2015.

AB  - Deep learning models have demonstrated superior performance in several real-world application problems such as image classification and speech processing. However, creating these models in sensitive domains like healthcare typically requires addressing certain privacy challenges that bring unique concerns. One effective way to handle such private data concerns is to generate realistic synthetic data that can provide practically acceptable data quality as well as be used to improve model performance. To tackle this challenge, we develop a differentially private framework for synthetic data generation using Renyi differential privacy. Our approach builds on convolutional autoencoders and convolutional generative adversarial networks to preserve critical characteristics of the generated synthetic data. In addition, our model can capture the temporal information and feature correlations present in the original data. We demonstrate that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art models under the same privacy budget using several publicly available benchmark medical datasets in both supervised and unsupervised settings.

AB  - Acquiring high-quality misspelling data at large scale to train quality search speller models is key but challenging. Synthetic data generation approaches as a major focus in literature are usually linguistics dependent, challenging in domain adaptation, and centered around empirical choices based on error patterns generalized from limited annotated datasets. Mining based approaches on the other hand are not sufficiently studied and don't ensure ground-truth corrections. Both methodologies also lack focus on other strategical considerations which matter for the final quality of the data and model. We introduce a novel, comprehensive and production-proved distributed mining framework which is able to generate large-scale quality data to train search speller models. The enabling method eliminates dependency on human judged data, and fully scales exploring, training and deploying high-quality speller models with maximal efficiency. The work has been demonstrated by production launches of spell correction to worldwide markets for Apple Maps search. Our approach should also facilitate the general synthetic data generation approaches in applicable domains to get rid of the human annotation dependency.

AB  - The intentional targeting of components in a cloud based application, in order to artificially inflate usage bills, is an issue application owners have faced for many years. This has occurred under many guises, such as: Economic Denial of Sustainability (EDoS), Click Fraud and even secondary effects of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. With the advent of commercial offerings of serverless computing circa 2015, a variant of the EDoS attack has emerged, termed, Denial-of-Wallet (DoW). We describe our development of a simulation tool as safe means to research these attacks as well as to generate datasets for the training of future mitigation systems to combat DoW. We believe that DoW may become increasingly prevalent as applications further utilise services based on a pay-per-invocation cost model. Given that the damage caused is purely financial, such attacks may not be disclosed as application users are not directly effected. As such, we believe that the development of an attack simulator and specific testing of security measures against this niche attack will be able to provide previously unavailable data and insights for the research community. We have developed a prototype DoW simulator that can emulate multiple months worth of API calls in a matter of hours for ease of training data generation. Our aspiration for the future of this work is to provide a system and starting point for research on this form of attack. We present our work on such a system Denial-of-Wallet Test Simulator (DoWTS) - a system that allows for safe testing of theorised DoW attacks against serverless applications via synthetic data generation. We also expand upon prior research on DoW and provide an analysis on the lack of specific safety measures for DoW.

AB  - BackgroundWe previously developed grading metrics for quantitative performance measurement for simulated endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG) to create a scalar reference to classify subjects into experts and novices. In this work, we used synthetic data generation and expanded our skill level analysis using machine learning techniques.MethodsWe used the synthetic data generation algorithm SMOTE to expand and balance our dataset of seven actual simulated ESG procedures using synthetic data. We performed optimization to seek optimum metrics to classify experts and novices by identifying the most critical and distinctive sub-tasks. We used support vector machine (SVM), AdaBoost, K-nearest neighbors (KNN) Kernel Fisher discriminant analysis (KFDA), random forest, and decision tree classifiers to classify surgeons as experts or novices after grading. Furthermore, we used an optimization model to create weights for each task and separate the clusters by maximizing the distance between the expert and novice scores.ResultsWe split our dataset into a training set of 15 samples and a testing dataset of five samples. We put this dataset through six classifiers, SVM, KFDA, AdaBoost, KNN, random forest, and decision tree, resulting in 0.94, 0.94, 1.00, 1.00, 1.00, and 1.00 accuracy, respectively, for training and 1.00 accuracy for the testing results for SVM and AdaBoost. Our optimization model maximized the distance between the expert and novice groups from 2 to 53.72.ConclusionThis paper shows that feature reduction, in combination with classification algorithms such as SVM and KNN, can be used in tandem to classify endoscopists as experts or novices based on their results recorded using our grading metrics. Furthermore, this work introduces a non-linear constraint optimization to separate the two clusters and find the most important tasks using weights.

AB  - Object detection is a task in computer vision that involves detecting instances of visual objects of a particular class in digital images. Numerous computer vision tasks highly depend on object detection such as instance segmentation, image captioning and object tracking. A major purpose of object detection is to develop computational models that provide inputs crucial to computer vision applications. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have recently become popular due to their key roles in enabling object detection. However, the performance of CNNs is largely dependent upon the quality and quantity of training datasets, which are often difficult to obtain in real-world applications. In order to ensure the robustness of such models, it is vital that training instances are provided under various randomized conditions. These conditions are typically a combination of a variety of factors, including lighting conditions, object location, the presence of multiple objects in the scene, varieties of backgrounds, and the angle of the camera. In particular, companies, depending on their applications (such as fault detection, anomaly detection, condition monitoring, predictive quality and so on), require specialized models for their custom products and so always face difficulties in providing a large number of randomized conditioned instances of their objects. The primary reason is that the process of capturing randomized conditioned images of real objects is usually costly, time-consuming, and challenging in practice. Due to the efficiency gained so far via the use of synthetic data for training such systems, synthetic data has recently attracted considerable attention. This paper presents an end-to-end synthetic data generation method for building a robust object detection model for customized products using NVIDIA Omniverse and CNNs. In this paper, we demonstrate and evaluate our contribution to the modeling of chess pieces, where a total accuracy of 98.8 % was obtained.

AB  - It is important to find the target as soon as possible for search and rescue operations. Surveillance camera systems and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are used to support search and rescue. Automatic object detection is important because a person cannot monitor multiple surveillance screens simultaneously for 24 hours. Also, the object is often too small to be recognized by the human eye on the surveillance screen. This study used UAVs around the Port of Houston and fixed surveillance cameras to build an automatic target detection system that supports the US Coast Guard (USCG) to help find targets (e.g., person overboard). We combined image segmentation, enhancement, and convolution neural networks to reduce detection time to detect small targets. We compared the performance between the auto-detection system and the human eye. Our system detected the target within 8 seconds, but the human eye detected the target within 25 seconds. Our systems also used synthetic data generation and data augmentation techniques to improve target detection accuracy. This solution may help the search and rescue operations of the first responders in a timely manner.

AB  - Differentially Private (DP) synthetic data generation (SDG) algorithms take as input a dataset containing private, confidential information and produce synthetic data with comparable statistical characteristics. The significance of such techniques is rising due to the growing awareness of the extent of data collection and usage in organizational contexts, as well as the implementation of new stricter data privacy regulations. Given the growing academic interest in DP SDG techniques, our study intends to perform a comparative evaluation of the statistical similarities and utility (in terms of machine learning performances) of a specific set of related algorithms in the realistic context of credit-risk and banking. The study compares PrivBayes, Copula-Shirley, and DPCopula algorithms and their variants using a proposed evaluation framework across three different datasets. The purpose of this study is to perform a thorough assessment of the score and to investigate the impact of different values of the privacy budget (epsilon) on the quality and usability of synthetic data generated by each method. As a result, we highlight and examine the deficiencies and capabilities of each algorithm in relation to the features' properties of the original data.

AB  - Time-series modeling is a well-studied topic of classical analysis and machine learning. However, large datasets are required to obtain the model with a better prediction quality with the increasing model complexity. Therefore, some applications demand synthetic datasets that are preserving modeling-sensitive properties. Another application of synthetic data is data anonymization. The synthetic data generation algorithm may be split into two parts: the time-series modeling and the synthetic data generation parts. The model must be interpretable to obtain the synthetic data with good quality. The model parameter interpretation allows controlling generation by adding noise to different groups of parameters. In the paper, the evolutionary multi-objective closed-form algebraic expressions discovery approach that allows obtaining the model in the form that may be analyzed using the mathematics is proposed. The analysis allows the interpretation of the model parameters for the controllable generation of the synthetic data. The notion of synthetic data quality is discussed. The examples of the synthetic time-series generation based on two datasets with different properties are shown. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Support Vector Machine (SVM) is on one of its kind of data mining algorithm, tends to always give away the global optimum solution to any given problem because of its convex optimization problem solving approach. SVM learns from the given training data and generates a linear hyperplane classifying the given instances. The training instances which are near this separating hyperplane arc called support vectors, using which predictions arc obtained. In other words, SVM considers the support vectors as important instances for prediction purposes and ignores other instances which are much away from hyperplane boundary. In this project the ability of SVM i.e. extraction of support vectors is explored further and active learning based synthetic data generation (nearest to the support vectors) is employed. Synthetic data generation near support vectors would provide the classification algorithm (Naive Bayes algorithm in this project) with some extra and suitable instances to learn from which in-turn expected to result in improving the prediction accuracy of the classifier used. Results have shown that Naive Bayes classifier yielded superior accuracy using the modified dataset when compared to the accuracy yielded using original data available.

AB  - Synthetic data generation in omics mimics real-world biological data, providing alternatives for training and evaluation of genomic analysis tools, controlling differential expression, and exploring data architecture. We previously developed Precious1GPT, a multimodal transformer trained on transcriptomic and methylation data, along with metadata, for predicting biological age and identifying dual-purpose therapeutic targets potentially implicated in aging and age-associated diseases. In this study, we introduce Precious2GPT, a multimodal architecture that integrates Conditional Diffusion (CDiffusion) and decoder-only Multi-omics Pretrained Transformer (MoPT) models trained on gene expression and DNA methylation data. Precious2GPT excels in synthetic data generation, outperforming Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs), CDiffusion, and MoPT. We demonstrate that Precious2GPT is capable of generating representative synthetic data that captures tissue- and age-specific information from real transcriptomics and methylomics data. Notably, Precious2GPT surpasses other models in age prediction accuracy using the generated data, and it can generate data beyond 120 years of age. Furthermore, we showcase the potential of using this model in identifying gene signatures and potential therapeutic targets in a colorectal cancer case study.

AB  - Real data with privacy and confidentiality concerns are not often available or are too expensive to afford in respect of both time and money. In this situation, it is a good alternative to use synthetic data. The objective of this research is to generate realistic synthetic data so that people can use it freely. We propose a synthetic data generation model based on boundary-seeking generative adversarial networks (BGANs)-designated as medical BGAN or medBGAN and compare its performances with an existing method medical GAN (medGAN). We aim to perform the investigation on several datasets in two different domains: electronic health records (EHRs) in the medical domain and a crime dataset in the City of Los Angeles Police Department. Firstly, we train the models and generate synthetic data by using these trained models. We then analyze and compare the models' performance by applying some statistical methods (dimension-wise average and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) and two machine learning tasks (association rule mining and prediction). The comprehensive analysis of this study shows that the proposed model is more effective in generating realistic synthetic data than those generated using medGAN.

TI  - Synthetic PPG generation from haemodynamic model with baroreflex autoregulation: a Digital twin of cardiovascular system
T2  - 2019 41ST ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)
LA  - English
CP  - 41st Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)
AB  - Synthetic data generation has recently emerged as a substitution technique for handling the problem of bulk data needed in training machine learning algorithms. Healthcare, primarily cardiovascular domain is a major area where synthetic physiological data like Photoplethysmogram (PPG), Electrocardiogram (ECG), Phonocardiogram (PCG), etc. are being used to improve accuracy of machine learning algorithm. Conventional synthetic data generation approach using mathematical formulations lack interpretability. Hence, aim of this paper is to generate synthetic PPG signal from a Digital twin platform replicating cardiovascular system. Such system can serve the dual purpose of replicating the physical system, so as to simulate specific 'what if' scenarios as well as to generate large scale synthetic data with patho-physiological interpretability. Cardio-vascular Digital twin is modeled with a two chambered heart, haemodynamic equations and a baroreflex based pressure control mechanism to generate blood pressure and flow variations. Synthetic PPG signal is generated from the model for healthy and Atherosclerosis condition. Initial validation of the platform has been made on the basis of efficiency of the platform in clustering Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) and non CAD PPG data by extracting features from the synthetically generated PPG and comparing that with PPG obtained from Physionet data.

AB  - Access to individual-level health data is essential for gaining new insights and advancing science. In particular, modern methods based on artificial intelligence rely on the availability of and access to large datasets. In the health sector, access to individual-level data is often challenging due to privacy concerns. A promising alternative is the generation of fully synthetic data, i.e., data generated through a randomised process that have similar statistical properties as the original data, but do not have a one-to-one correspondence with the original individual-level records. In this study, we use a state-of-the-art synthetic data generation method and perform in-depth quality analyses of the generated data for a specific use case in the field of nutrition. We demonstrate the need for careful analyses of synthetic data that go beyond descriptive statistics and provide valuable insights into how to realise the full potential of synthetic datasets. By extending the methods, but also by thoroughly analysing the effects of sampling from a trained model, we are able to largely reproduce significant real-world analysis results in the chosen use case.

AB  - Research over gait analysis has become more relevant in the last years, especially as a tool to detect early frailty signs. However, data gathering is often difficult and requires lots of resources. Synthetic data generation is a great complementary tool for data gathering that enables the augmentation of existing datasets. Despite not being a new concept, it has gained popularity in the last years thanks to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), a neural network architecture capable of creating data indistinguishable from the original one. In this article deep-convolutional GANs has been used to artificially expand a gait dataset containing data of the lower part of the body. The synthetic data has been studied through three approaches: looking animations of the points and comparing them to the originals; applying principal component analysis algorithm to both datasets to visually assess how each of them is distributed; and by extracting different features from both datasets to compare their statistical differences. The evaluation showed promising results, which opens a path for using synthetic data generation in the gait analysis domain.

AB  - The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has unlocked unprecedented potential for comprehending and generating human-like text, fueling advances in the finance domain - a tool that can shape investment strategies and market predictions. Nevertheless, challenges stemming from the necessity for extensive labeled data and the imperative for data privacy remain. The generation of high-quality synthetic data emerges as a promising avenue to circumvent these issues. In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology, named "Reinforcement Prompting", to address these challenges. Our strategy employs a policy network as a Selector to generate prompts, and an LLM as an Executor to produce financial synthetic data. This synthetic data generation process preserves data privacy and mitigates the dependency on real-world labeled datasets. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through experimental evaluations. Our results indicate that models trained on synthetic data generated via our approach exhibit competitive performance when compared to those trained on actual financial data, thereby bridging the performance gap. This research provides a novel solution to the challenges of data privacy and labeled data scarcity in financial sentiment analysis, offering considerable advancement in the field of financial machine learning.

TI  - Synthetic data generation to support irregular sampling in sensor networks
T2  - GEOSENSOR NETWORKS
LA  - English
CP  - 1st GeoSensor Networks Workshop
AB  - Despite increasing interest, sensor network research is still in its initial phase. Few real systems have been deployed and little data is available to test proposed protocol and data management designs. Most sensor network research to date uses randomly generated data input to simulate their systems. Some researchers have proposed using environmental monitoring data obtained from remote sensing or in-situ instrumentation. In many cases, neither of these approaches is relevant, because they are either collected from regular grid topology, or too coarse grained. This paper proposes to use synthetic data generation techniques to generate irregular data topology from the available experimental data. Our goal is to more realistically evaluate sensor network system designs before large scale field deployment.
   Our evaluation results on the radar data set of weather observations shows that the spatial correlation of the original and synthetic data are similar. Moreover, visual comparison shows that the synthetic data retains interesting properties (e.g., edges) of the original data. Our case study on the DIMENSIONS system demonstrates how synthetic data helps to evaluate the system over an irregular topology, and points out the need to improve the algorithm.

This paper presents a comprehensive overview of data augmentation techniques in time series analysis, with a specific focus on their applications within deep learning and machine learning. We commence with a systematic methodology for literature selection, curating 757 articles from prominent databases. Subsequent sections delve into various data augmentation techniques, encompassing traditional approaches like interpolation and advanced methods like Synthetic Data Generation, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). These techniques address complexities inherent in time series data. Moreover, we scrutinize limitations, including computational costs and overfitting risks. However, it's essential to note that our analysis does not end with limitations. We also comprehensively analyzed the advantages and applicability of the techniques under consideration. This holistic evaluation allows us to provide a balanced perspective. In summary, this overview illuminates data augmentation's role in time series analysis within deep and machine -learning contexts. It provides valuable insights for researchers and practitioners, advancing these fields and charting paths for future exploration.

AB  - With the advent of Artificial Intelligence for healthcare, data synthesis methods present crucial benefits in facilitating the fast development of AI models while protecting data subjects and bypassing the need to engage with the complexity of data sharing and processing agreements. Existing technologies focus on synthesising real-time physiological and physical records based on regular time intervals. Real health data are, however, characterised by irregularities and multimodal variables that are still hard to reproduce, preserving the correlation across time and different dimensions. This paper presents two novel techniques for synthetic data generation of real-time multimodal electronic health and physical records, (a) the Temporally Correlated Multimodal Generative Adversarial Network and (b) the Document Sequence Generator.

AB  - We present MeqSilhouette v2.0 (MeqSv2), a fully polarimetric, time-and frequency-resolved synthetic data generation software for simulating millimetre (mm) wavelength very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations with heterogeneous arrays. Synthetic data are a critical component in understanding real observations, testing calibration and imaging algorithms, and predicting performance metrics of existing or proposed sites. MeqSv2 applies physics-based instrumental and atmospheric signal corruptions constrained by empirically derived site and station parameters to the data. The new version is capable of applying instrumental polarization effects and various other spectrally resolved effects using the Radio Interferometry Measurement Equation (RIME) formalism and produces synthetic data compatible with calibration pipelines designed to process real data. We demonstrate the various corruption capabilities of MeqSv2 using different arrays, with a focus on the effect of complex bandpass gains on closure quantities for the EHT at 230 GHz. We validate the frequency-dependent polarization leakage implementation by performing polarization self-calibration of synthetic EHT data using PolSolve. We also note the potential applications for cm-wavelength VLBI array analysis and design and future directions.

AB  - Identity tracking and instance segmentation are crucial in several areas of biological research. Behavior analysis of individuals in groups of similar animals is a task that emerges frequently in agriculture or pharmaceutical studies, among others. Automated annotation of many hours of surveillance videos can facilitate a large number of biological studies/experiments, which otherwise would not be feasible. Solutions based on machine learning generally perform well in tracking and instance segmentation; however, in the case of identical, unmarked instances (e.g., white rats or mice), even state-of-the-art approaches can frequently fail. We propose a pipeline of deep generative models for identity tracking and instance segmentation of highly similar instances, which, in contrast to most region-based approaches, exploits edge information and consequently helps to resolve ambiguity in heavily occluded cases. Our method is trained by synthetic data generation techniques, not requiring prior human annotation. We show that our approach greatly outperforms other state-of-the-art unsupervised methods in identity tracking and instance segmentation of unmarked rats in real-world laboratory video recordings.

AB  - This work studies the feasibility of a novel two-step algorithm for infrastructure and object positioning, using pairwise distances. The proposal is based on the optimization algorithms, Scaling-by-Majorizing-a-Complicated-Function and the Limited-Memory-Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shannon. A qualitative evaluation of these algorithms is performed for 3D positioning. As the final stage, smoothing filtering techniques are applied to estimate the trajectory, from the previously obtained positions. This approach can also be used as a synthetic gesture data generator framework. This framework is independent from the hardware and can be used to simulate the estimation of trajectories from noisy distances gathered with a large range of sensors by modifying the noise properties of the initial distances. The framework is validated, using a system of ultrasound transceivers. The results show this framework to be an efficient and simple positioning and filtering approach, accurately reconstructing the real path followed by the mobile object while maintaining low latency. Furthermore, these capabilities can be exploited by using the proposed algorithms for synthetic data generation, as demonstrated in this work, where synthetic ultrasound gesture data are generated.

AB  - Synthetic data generation has been widely adopted in software testing, data privacy, imbalanced learning, artificial intelligence explanation, etc. In all such contexts, it is important to generate plausible data samples. A common assumption of approaches widely used for data generation is the independence of the features. However, typically, the variables of a dataset depend on one another, and these dependencies are not considered in data generation leading to the creation of implausible records. The main problem is that dependencies among variables are typically unknown. In this paper, we design a synthetic dataset generator for tabular data that is able to discover nonlinear causalities among the variables and use them at generation time. State-of-the-art methods for nonlinear causal discovery are typically inefficient. We boost them by restricting the causal discovery among the features appearing in the frequent patterns efficiently retrieved by a pattern mining algorithm. To validate our proposal, we design a framework for generating synthetic datasets with known causalities. Wide experimentation on many synthetic datasets and real datasets with known causalities shows the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB  - Differential privacy (DP) provides a robust framework for ensuring individual privacy while analyzing population data. To achieve DP, statistical noise is added to query results before publication, but accurately determining the required noise is challenging, especially for user-defined functions. Existing approaches often rely on limited pre-defined functions with known sensitivities, limiting the expressivity of DP systems. In this paper, we present a novel embedded domain-specific language (eDSL) in Haskell to automatically approximate the sensitivity of user-defined linear functions commonly used in synthetic data generation. Our approach leverages Haskell's expressive type system and generic programming principles to infer function ranges, enabling us to approximate sensitivities efficiently. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our eDSL by integrating it into the Multiplicative Weights Exponential Mechanism (MWEM) for synthetic data generation. Our solution guides users when updating functions, ensuring proper sensitivity consideration, enhancing the robustness and reliability of synthetic data algorithms. By adopting this straightforward yet effective approach, we streamline the sensitivity calculation process for user-defined functions, making it more accessible and user-friendly. The contributions of our work include an eDSL capable of approximating sensitivity for linear functions and its evaluation within the context of MWEM workloads.

AB  - Synthetic data is highly useful for training machine learning systems performing image-based 3D reconstruction, as synthetic data has applications in both extending existing generalizable datasets and being tailored to train neural networks for specific learning tasks of interest. In this paper, we introduce and utilize a synthetic data generation suite capable of generating data given existing 3D scene models as input. Specifically, we use our tool to generate image sequences for use with Multi-View Stereo (MVS), moving a camera through the virtual space according to user-chosen camera parameters. We evaluate how the given camera parameters and type of 3D environment affect how applicable the generated image sequences are to the MVS task using five pre-trained neural networks on image sequences generated from three different 3D scene datasets. We obtain generated predictions for each combination of parameter value and input image sequence, using standard error metrics to analyze the differences in depth predictions on image sequences across 3D datasets, parameters, and networks. Among other results, we find that camera height and vertical camera viewing angle are the parameters that cause the most variation in depth prediction errors on these image sequences.

AB  - This study employs machine learning models to explore stock price prediction for Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB), Malaysia's primary electricity provider. It addresses the limitations of previous studies by incorporating various input variables, including the stock market, technical, financial, and economic data. This study also tackles the issue of imbalanced class distribution due to small datasets of stock market data by generating synthetic data using Synthetic Minority Over -Sampling Technique (SMOTE) and Generative Adversarial Network -Synthetic Minority Over -Sampling Technique (GAN-SMOTE) techniques. The performance of four classifier models (random forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is evaluated without any synthetic data and with synthetic data generated. The SMOTE -ANN model is the bestperforming model, exhibiting superior accuracy of 93%, F1 -Score of 92%, precision of 90%, recall of 94%, and specificity of 92%. Overall, this research provides valuable insights into TNB stock price movements, offers a solution for imbalanced class distribution, and identifies the top -performing model for predicting TNB stock price movement. These findings are relevant to investors, analysts, and organisations in the utility sector .

AB  - Machine learning is becoming an integral part of cybersecurity today, particularly in the area of network anomaly detection. However, machine learning techniques require large volumes of data to be effective. Although there are some datasets available for training Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS), many of them are outdated or do not contain enough useful information for training/classification of NIDS. Therefore, generating synthetic data that is realistic is imperative for training effective intrusion detection systems. Currently, the most common methods for generating synthetic data are simulation or emulation through a software package like OPNET, and then machine learning is used to analyze the dataset for correctness. This paper argues for an approach to utilize machine learning to develop models in order to generate the datasets themselves for NIDS, which is an approach that is not commonly used. In this paper, we discuss some of the well-known available datasets, the features that make up a good dataset, the reasons for utilizing generative modeling to synthesize network data and lay out a basic approach to developing generative models for synthetic data by leveraging machine learning.

AB  - The on-demand economy has attracted significant attention in recent years, with a rapid growth in on-demand services ranging from ride-hailing to package delivery and grocery pickup. However, real-world spatio-temporal data that can be used for evaluating research on on-demand brokers design and supply-demand regulation are either not publicly available or are very limited in their spatial coverage. Research efforts in generating synthetic spatio-temporal datasets such as traffic generators have only focused on one side of the business model, particularly the demand side, and thus are not convenient for studying market variations such as the problem of supply-demand imbalance. In addition, many of these generators do not accurately reflect real-world data characteristics. In this paper, we propose a supply and demand aware framework for generating synthetic datasets for the purpose of designing on-demand spatial service brokers, while also capturing real-world data characteristics by leveraging multiple publicly available data sources. We also present an evaluation of the quality and performance of our proposed framework.

AB  - The need for more and better information for decision making is fundamental in modern organizations, especially in the financial industry. One type of this information is time series, which allow prediction and estimation of different scenarios, but are difficult to obtain for small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). This research presents the design and validation of a generative adversarial network (GAN) capable of generating synthetic data for daily sales of Chilean SME. The problem that needs to be resolved is the lack of this kind of data within a Chilean fintech company called Dank. This data can be useful in developing an automatic risk evaluation model and, therefore, in reducing business process time, since risk evaluation is currently being carried out by people. The solution allows maintaining the anonymity of the data and using GAN to obtain different synthetic time series, increasing the data by 10%. It uses images from a vector of random numbers that are in temporal coherence and equal distribution. This research allows SMEs to obtain a greater amount of data, with a simple solution, to make better decisions.

AB  - Synthetic data are increasingly being recognized for their potential to address serious real-world challenges in various domains. They provide innovative solutions to combat the data scarcity, privacy concerns, and algorithmic biases commonly used in machine learning applications. Synthetic data preserve all underlying patterns and behaviors of the original dataset while altering the actual content. The methods proposed in the literature to generate synthetic data vary from large language models (LLMs), which are pre-trained on gigantic datasets, to generative adversarial networks (GANs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs). This study provides a systematic review of the various techniques proposed in the literature that can be used to generate synthetic data to identify their limitations and suggest potential future research areas. The findings indicate that while these technologies generate synthetic data of specific data types, they still have some drawbacks, such as computational requirements, training stability, and privacy-preserving measures which limit their real-world usability. Addressing these issues will facilitate the broader adoption of synthetic data generation techniques across various disciplines, thereby advancing machine learning and data-driven solutions.

KW  - object detection
AB  - Deep learning-based methods have demonstrated remarkable success in object detection tasks when abundant training data are available. However, in the industrial domain, acquiring a sufficient amount of training data has been a challenge. Currently, many synthetic datasets are created using 3D modeling software, which can simulate real-world scenarios and objects but often cannot achieve complete accuracy and realism. In this paper, we propose a synthetic data generation framework for industrial object detection tasks based on image-to-image translation. To address the issue of low image quality that can arise during the image translation process, we have replaced the original feature extraction module with the Residual Dense Block (RDB) module. We employ the RDB-CycleGAN network to transform CAD models into realistic images. Additionally, we have introduced the SSIM loss function to strengthen the network constraints of the generator and conducted a quantitative analysis of the improved RDB-CycleGAN-generated synthetic data. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, the synthetic data we generate effectively enhance the performance of object detection algorithms on real images. Compared to using CAD models directly, synthetic data adapt better to real-world scenarios and improve the model's generalization ability.

AB  - Ensuring continued quality is challenging, especially when customer satisfaction is the provided service. It seems to become easier with new technologies like Artificial Intelligence. However, field data are necessary to design an intelligent assistant but are not always available. Synthetic data are used mainly to replace real data. Made with a Generative Adversarial Network or a rendering engine, they aim to be as efficient as real ones in training a Neural Network. When synthetic data generation meets the challenge of object detection, its capacity to deal with the defect detection challenge is unknown. Here we demonstrate how to generate these synthetic data to detect defects. Through iterations, we apply different methods from literature to generate synthetic data for object detection, from how to extract a defect from the few data we have to how to organize the scene before data synthesis. Our study suggests that defect detection may be performed by training an object detector neural network with synthetic data and gives a protocol to do so even if at this point, no field experiments have been conducted to verify our detector performances under real conditions. This experiment is the starting point for developing a mobile and automatic defect detector that might be adapted to ensure new product quality.

AB  - This study introduces a novel Quantum Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network approach with a Gradient Penalty (QWGAN-GP) model that leverages a quantum generator alongside a classical discriminator to synthetically generate time series data. This approach aims to accurately replicate the statistical properties of the S&P 500 index. The synthetic data generated by this model were compared to the original series using various metrics, including Wasserstein distance, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance, and entropy measures, among others. The outcomes demonstrate the model's robustness, with the generated data exhibiting a high degree of fidelity to the statistical characteristics of the original data. Additionally, this study explores the applicability of the synthetic time series in enhancing prediction models. An LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory)-based model was developed to evaluate the impact of incorporating synthetic data on forecasting accuracy, particularly focusing on general trends and extreme market events. The findings reveal that models trained on a mix of synthetic and real data significantly outperform those trained solely on historical data, improving predictive performance.

AB  - Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) has been used to measure vital signs such as heart rate, heart rate variability, blood pressure (BP), and blood oxygen. Recent studies adopt features developed with photoplethysmography (PPG) to achieve contactless BP measurement via rPPG. These features can be classified into two groups: time or phase differences from multiple signals, or waveform feature analysis from a single signal. Here we devise a solution to extract the time difference information from the rPPG signal captured at 30 FPS. We also propose a deep learning model architecture to estimate BP from the extracted features. To prevent overfitting and compensate for the lack of data, we leverage a multi-model design and generate synthetic data. We also use subject information related to BP to assist in model learning. For real-world usage, the subject information is replaced with values estimated from face images, with performance that is still better than the state-of-the-art. To our best knowledge, the improvements can be achieved because of: 1) the model selection with estimated subject information, 2) replacing the estimated subject information with the real one, 3) the InfoGAN assistance training (synthetic data generation), and 4) the time difference features as model input. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we conduct a series of experiments, including dynamic BP measurement for many single subjects and nighttime BP measurement with infrared lighting. Our approach reduces the MAE from 15.49 to 8.78 mmHg for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and 10.56 to 6.16 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure(DBP) on a self-constructed rPPG dataset. On the Taipei Veterans General Hospital(TVGH) dataset for nighttime applications, the MAE is reduced from 21.58 to 11.12 mmHg for SBP and 9.74 to 7.59 mmHg for DBP, with improvement ratios of 48.47% and 22.07% respectively.

AB  - Synthetic data are becoming increasingly important mechanisms for sharing data among collaborators and with the public. Multiple methods for the generation of synthetic data have been proposed, but many have short comings with respect to maintaining the statistical properties of the original data. We propose a new method for fully synthetic data generation that leverages linear and integer mathematical programming models in order to match the moments of the original data in the synthetic data. This method has no inherent disclosure risk and does not require parametric or distributional assumptions. We demonstrate this methodology using the Framingham Heart Study. Existing synthetic data methods that use chained equations were compared with our approach. We fit Cox proportional hazards, logistic regression, and nonparametric models to synthetic data and compared with models fitted to the original data. True coverage, the proportion of synthetic data parameter confidence intervals that include the original data's parameter estimate, was 100% for parametric models when up to four moments were matched, and consistently outperformed the chained equations approach. The area under the curve and accuracy of the nonparametric models trained on synthetic data marginally differed when tested on the full original data. Models were also trained on synthetic data and a partition of original data and were tested on a held-out portion of original data. Fourth-order moment matched synthetic data outperformed others with respect to fitted parametric models but did not always outperform other methods with fitted nonparametric models. No single synthetic data method consistently outperformed others when assessing the performance of nonparametric models. The performance of fourth-order moment matched synthetic data in fitting parametric models suggests its use in these cases. Our empirical results also suggest that the performance of synthetic data generation techniques, including the moment matching approach, is less stable for use with nonparametric models. The benefits of the moment matching approach should be weighed against additional computational costs. In summary, our results demonstrate that the introduced moment matching approach may be considered as an alternative to existing synthetic data generation methods.

AB  - The intensification of governmental legislation and the social awareness around data privacy protection severely constrains organizations ' data utilization capabilities. As a result, the interest in data anonymization techniques, which should preserve the patterns present in the original data but mitigate the risks of privacy leakage, has also increased. While conventional methods may compromise privacy, recently proposed deep learning generative approaches are computationally expensive and unreliable when used in tabular datasets, hindering the democratization and usability of data. In this paper, we explore this trade-off between privacy and the quality of the anonymized data, establishing a new equilibrium obtained using a synthetic oversampling technique, SMOTE -NC, on a non-linear compressed version of the input space, achieved with the application of UMAP. The introduced approach, UMAP-SMOTENC, constitutes an efficient and consistent solution that can be used without significant efforts on hyperparameter tuning or resourcing to massive computing infrastructures. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the robustness of the proposed solution, comparing several metrics and models across eight datasets with diverse characteristics. The results achieved suggest that the presented method can efficiently synthesize privacy -aware data while conserving the relevant patterns of the real dataset, particularly those required for classification tasks.

CP  - International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics
AB  - The creation of realistic, synthetic datasets has several purposes with growing demand in recent times, e.g. privacy protection and other cases where real data cannot be easily shared. A multitude of primarily neural networks (NNs), e.g. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), or Bayesian Network (BN) approaches have been created to tackle this problem, however these require extensive compute resources, lack interpretability, and in some instances lack replication fidelity as well. We propose a hybrid, probabilistic approach for synthesizing pairwise independent tabular data, called Synthsonic. A sequence of well-understood, invertible statistical transformations removes first-order correlations, then a Bayesian Network jointly models continuous and categorical variables, and a calibrated discriminative learner captures the remaining dependencies. Replication studies on MIT's SDGym benchmark show marginally or significantly better performance than all prior BN-based approaches, while being competitive with NN-based approaches (first place in 10 out of 13 benchmark datasets). The computational time required to learn the data distribution is at least one order of magnitude lower than the NN methods. Furthermore, inspecting intermediate results during the synthetic data generation allows easy diagnostics and tailored corrections. We believe the combination of out-of-the-box performance, speed and interpretability make this method a significant addition to the synthetic data generation toolbox.

AB  - Synthetic data generation plays a crucial role in many areas where data is scarce and privacy/confidentiality is a significant concern. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), arguably one of the most widely used data synthesis techniques, allow for the training of a model (i.e., generator) that can generate real-looking data by playing a min-max game with a discriminator model. When multiple organizations are reluctant to share their sensitive data, GANs models can be trained in a federated manner, commonly with the use of differential privacy (DP). In order to achieve a reasonable level of model utility, DP trades privacy exhibiting vulnerability to various attacks (e.g., membership inference attack). In this paper, we propose a hybrid solution, PP-FedGAN, to the asynchronous federated, privacy-preserving training of GANs models by combining the CKKS homomorphic encryption (HE) scheme with differential privacy. The addition of HE results in around 10 seconds of overhead on the client side per round and 115 seconds on the entire training procedure. We also analyze the security of PP-FedGAN under the honest-but-curious security model. Where stronger security guarantees are required, our proposal presents a better alternative to solutions that only employ DP.

AB  - Clinical research relies on high-quality patient data, however, obtaining big data sets is costly and access to existing data is often hindered by privacy and regulatory concerns. Synthetic data generation holds the promise of effectively bypassing these boundaries allowing for simplified data accessibility and the prospect of synthetic control cohorts. We employed two different methodologies of generative artificial intelligence - CTAB-GAN+ and normalizing flows (NFlow) - to synthesize patient data derived from 1606 patients with acute myeloid leukemia, a heterogeneous hematological malignancy, that were treated within four multicenter clinical trials. Both generative models accurately captured distributions of demographic, laboratory, molecular and cytogenetic variables, as well as patient outcomes yielding high performance scores regarding fidelity and usability of both synthetic cohorts (n = 1606 each). Survival analysis demonstrated close resemblance of survival curves between original and synthetic cohorts. Inter-variable relationships were preserved in univariable outcome analysis enabling explorative analysis in our synthetic data. Additionally, training sample privacy is safeguarded mitigating possible patient re-identification, which we quantified using Hamming distances. We provide not only a proof-of-concept for synthetic data generation in multimodal clinical data for rare diseases, but also full public access to synthetic data sets to foster further research.

AB  - Wildfires are becoming more frequent in different parts of the globe, and the ability to predict when and where they will occur is a complex process. Identifying wildfire events with high probability of becoming a large wildfire is an important task for supporting initial attack planning. Different methods, including those that are physics-based, statistical, and based on machine learning (ML) are used in wildfire analysis. Among the whole, those based on machine learning are relatively novel. In addition, because the number of wildfires is much greater than the number of large wildfires, the dataset to be used in a ML model is imbalanced, resulting in overfitting or underfitting the results. In this manuscript, we propose to generate synthetic data from variables of interest together with ML models for the prediction of large wildfires. Specifically, five synthetic data generation methods have been evaluated, and their results are analyzed with four ML methods. The results yield an improvement in the prediction power when synthetic data are used, offering a new method to be taken into account in Decision Support Systems (DSS) when managing wildfires.

AB  - Environment recognition has been an important topic ever since the emergence of augmented reality (AR). For better experience in AR applications, environment recognition should be provided fast in real-time, where real-time object detection technologies could fulfill this requirement. However, training object detectors for AR specific scenarios are often troublesome. The real-time nature of AR produces visual degradations such as motion blur or occlusion by interaction, which make detectors trained with plain data difficult to detect objects exposed in such complex situations. Also, since gathering and labeling training data from scratch is a heavy burden, we need to resort to synthesized training data but previous synthetic data generation frameworks do not consider the aforementioned issue. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new synthetic data generation framework which includes visual variations such as motion blur and occlusion occurred by distractors. By this simple modification, we show that including such variated data to the training dataset could dramatically improve real-time performance of object detectors by a high margin. Also, we stress that synthesizing training data with no more than three objects per image can achieve competitive performance compared to detectors trained with over four present in a single image. Experimental results both quantitatively and qualitatively supports our statements and shows the superiority of our method.

AB  - With the rapid advancements in machine learning, the health care paradigm is shifting from treatment towards prevention. The smart health care industry relies on the availability of large-scale health datasets in order to benefit from machine learning-based services. As a consequence, preserving the individuals' privacy becomes vital for sharing sensitive personal information. Synthetic datasets with generative models are considered to be one of the most promising solutions for privacy-preserving data sharing. Among the generative models, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have emerged as the most impressive models for synthetic data generation in recent times. However, smart health care data is attributed with unique challenges such as volume, velocity, and various data types and distributions. We propose a GAN coupled with differential privacy mechanisms for generating a realistic and private smart health care dataset. The proposed approach is not only able to generate realistic synthetic data samples but also the differentially private data samples under different settings: learning from a noisy distribution or noising the learned distribution. We tested and evaluated our proposed approach using a real-world Fitbit dataset. Our results indicate that our proposed approach is able to generate quality synthetic and differentially private dataset that preserves the statistical properties of the original dataset.

AB  - Synthetic data generation based on state-of-the-art deep learning methods has recently emerged as a promising solution to replace the expensive and laborious collection of real data. Accordingly, several deep learning approaches have been developed to generate synthetic trajectories. These existing solutions assume that a dataset of true trajectories is available with sufficient size to train a deep learning model. However, considering that the trajectories usually contain sensitive information that individuals do not wish to disclose, this assumption is unrealistic in real world applications. We propose a novel privacy-preserving framework designed to effectively generate synthetic trajectories. In contrast to existing solutions to this problem, the proposed method exploits a differential privacy mechanism for collecting training data from individual users to protect the privacy of their locations. A deep learning model for trajectory generation is then trained using the perturbed training dataset collected under differential privacy. We present experimental results to demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively exploits a dataset of perturbed trajectories to train a deep learning model and can therefore generate synthetic trajectories with distributions similar to those of real data. Experimental results on real world datasets show that our method achieves significantly better performance than baseline approaches.

AB  - For many critical applications ranging from health care to social sciences, releasing personal data while protecting individual privacy is paramount. Over the years, data anonymization and synthetic data generation techniques have been proposed to address this challenge. Unfortunately, data anonymization approaches do not provide rigorous privacy guarantees. Although, there are existing synthetic data generation techniques that use rigorous definitions of differential privacy, to our knowledge, these techniques have not been compared extensively using different utility metrics.
   In this work, we provide two novel contributions. First, we compare existing techniques on different datasets using different utility metrics. Second, we present a novel approach that utilizes deep learning techniques coupled with an efficient analysis of privacy costs to generate differentially private synthetic datasets with higher data utility. We show that we can learn deep learning models that can capture relationship among multiple features, and then use these models to generate differentially private synthetic datasets. Our extensive experimental evaluation conducted on multiple datasets indicates that our proposed approach is more robust (i.e., one of the top performing technique in almost all type of data we have experimented) compared to the state-of-the art methods in terms of various data utility measures.

AB  - Accurate simulation of brain tumor data is crucial in medical imaging research for developing and assessing novel image enhancement techniques. We propose an approach to generate synthetic brain tumor data using StyleGAN3, a GAN model. Our objective is to explore the impact of varying gamma values and dataset sizes on the quality of synthetic brain tumor images via transfer learning from a pre-trained 512 X 512 model.
   We conducted three experiments with different gamma values and dataset sizes. The first two experiments employed gamma values of 6.6 and 8.2, respectively, using a dataset of 310 brain tumor images. The third experiment maintained the gamma value at 8.2 but reduced the dataset size to 155 images.
   We used FID and KID as evaluation metrics. Results show varying gamma values and dataset sizes significantly influence synthetic image quality. Higher gamma values generally yielded improved image quality. In another experiment, we obtained FID and KID scores of 67.856 and 0.013, respectively [1].
   These findings impact brain tumor imaging enhancement techniques. StyleGAN3 and transfer learning can efficiently generate synthetic brain tumor datasets, advancing medical image analysis and diagnosis. Our study underscores synthetic data generation's potential for enhancing medical image research.

KW  - NOISE
AB  - Synthetic data generation methods, and in particular, private synthetic data generation methods, are gaining popularity as a means to make copies of sensitive databases that can be shared widely for research and data analysis. Some of the fundamental operations in data analysis include analyzing aggregated statistics, e.g., count, sum, or median, on a subset of data satisfying some conditions. When synthetic data is generated, users may be interested in knowing if their aggregated queries generating such statistics can be reliably answered on the synthetic data, for instance, to decide if the synthetic data is suitable for specific tasks. However, the standard data generation systems do not provide "per-query" quality guarantees on the synthetic data, and the users have no way of knowing how much the aggregated statistics on the synthetic data can be trusted. To address this problem, we present a novel framework named DP-PQD (differentially-private per-query decider) to detect if the query answers on the private and synthetic datasets are within a user-specified threshold of each other while guaranteeing differential privacy. We give a suite of private algorithms for per-query deciders for count, sum, and median queries, analyze their properties, and evaluate them experimentally.

AB  - In the rapidly evolving landscape of cybersecurity, model extraction attacks pose a significant challenge, undermining the integrity of machine learning models by enabling adversaries to replicate proprietary algorithms without direct access. This paper presents a comprehensive study on model extraction attacks towards image classification models, focusing on the efficacy of various Deep Q-network (DQN) extensions for enhancing the performance of surrogate models. The goal is to identify the most efficient approaches for choosing images that optimize adversarial benefits. Additionally, we explore synthetic data generation techniques, including the Jacobian-based method, Linf-projected Gradient Descent (LinfPGD), and Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) aiming to facilitate the training of adversary models with enhanced performance. Our investigation also extends to the realm of data-free model extraction attacks, examining their feasibility and performance under constrained query budgets. Our investigation extends to the comparison of these methods under constrained query budgets, where the Prioritized Experience Replay (PER) technique emerges as the most effective, outperforming other DQN extensions and synthetic data generation methods. Through rigorous experimentation, including multiple trials to ensure statistical significance, this work provides valuable insights into optimizing model extraction attacks.

AB  - Data scarcity is a significant obstacle for modern data science and artificial intelligence research communities. The fact that abundant data are a key element of a powerful prediction model is well known through various past studies. However, industrial control systems (ICS) are operated in a closed environment due to security and privacy issues, so collected data are generally not disclosed. In this environment, synthetic data generation can be a good alternative. However, ICS datasets have time-series characteristics and include features with short- and long-term temporal dependencies. In this paper, we propose the attention-based variational recurrent autoencoder (AVRAE) for generating time-series ICS data. We first extend the evidence lower bound of the variational inference to time-series data. Then, a recurrent neural-network-based autoencoder is designed to take this as the objective. AVRAE employs the attention mechanism to effectively learn the long-term and short-term temporal dependencies ICS data implies. Finally, we present an algorithm for generating synthetic ICS time-series data using learned AVRAE. In a comprehensive evaluation using the ICS dataset HAI and various performance indicators, AVRAE successfully generated visually and statistically plausible synthetic ICS data.

AB  - Synthia is a versatile, modular and extensible Java-based data structure generation library. It is centered on the notion of "pickers", which are objects producing values of a given type on demand. Pickers are stateful and can be given as input to other pickers; this chaining principle can generate objects whose structure follows a complex pattern. The paper describes the core principles and key features of the library, including test input shrinking, provenance tracking, and object mutation.

AB  - Due to lack of experimental data and sophisticated models derived from such data, most data processing algorithms from the sensor network literature are evaluated with data generated from simple parametric models. Unfortunately, the type of data input used in the evaluation often significantly affect the algorithm performance. Our case studies of a few widely-studied sensor networks data processing algorithms demonstrated the need to evaluate algorithms with data across a range of parameters. In the end, we propose our synthetic data generation framework.

AB  - Differential privacy is a particular data privacy -preserving technology which enables synthetic data or statistical analysis results to be released with a minimum disclosure of private information from individual records. The tradeoff between privacy -preserving and utility guarantee is always a challenge for differential privacy technology, especially for synthetic data generation. In this paper, we propose a differentially private data synthesis algorithm for mixed -type data with correlation based on latent factor models. The proposed method can add a relatively small amount of noise to synthetic data under a given level of privacy protection while capturing correlation information. Moreover, the proposed algorithm can generate synthetic data preserving the same data type as mixed -type original data, which greatly improves the utility of synthetic data. The key idea of our method is to perturb the factor matrix and factor loading matrix to construct a synthetic data generation model, and to utilize link functions with privacy protection to ensure consistency of synthetic data type with original data. The proposed method can generate privacy -preserving synthetic data at low computation cost even when the original data is high -dimensional. In theory, we establish differentially private properties of the proposed method. Our numerical studies also demonstrate superb performance of the proposed method on the utility guarantee of the statistical analysis based on privacy -preserved synthetic data.

AB  - The performance of neural network models is often limited by the availability of big datasets. To treat this problem, we survey and develop novel synthetic data generation and augmentation techniques for enhancing low/zero-sample learning in satellite imagery. In addition to extending synthetic data generation approaches, we propose a hierarchical detection architecture to improve the utility of synthetic training samples. We consider existing techniques for producing synthetic imagery-3D models and neural style transfer-as well as introducing our own adversarially trained reskinning network, the GAN-Reskinner, to blend 3D models. Additionally, we test the value of synthetic data in a two-stage, hierarchical detection/classification model of our own construction. To test the effectiveness of synthetic imagery, we employ it in the training of detection models and our two stage model, and evaluate the resulting models on real satellite images. All modalities of synthetic data are tested extensively on practical, geospatial analysis problems. Our experiments show that synthetic data developed using our approach can often enhance detection performance, particularly when combined with some real training images. When the only source of data is synthetic, our GAN-Reskinner often boosts performance over conventionally rendered 3D models and in all cases, the hierarchical model outperforms the baseline end-to-end detection architecture.

AB  - Foreign object detection in manufacturing processes based on machine vision remains a challenge. The vastly different foreign objects and the complex background, as well as the scarcity of images with foreign objects constrain the application of traditional and deep learning methods, respectively. This paper discusses a novel method for intelligent foreign object detection and automatic data generation. A cascaded convolutional neural network to detect foreign objects on the surface of the tobacco pack is proposed. The cascaded network transforms the inspection into a two-stage YOLO based object detection, consisting of the tobacco pack localization and the foreign object detection. To address the scarcity of images with foreign objects, several data augmentation methods are introduced to avoid overfitting. Furthermore, a data generation methodology based on homography transformation and image fusion is developed to generate synthetic images with foreign objects. Models trained using synthetic images generated by this method show superior performance, which presents a viable approach to detecting newly introduced foreign objects. Extensive experimental results and comparisons on the tobacco pack foreign object dataset with several state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method. The proposed cascaded foreign object detection network and synthetic data generation methodology have the potential for widespread applications.

AB  - Array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) has merged as a highly efficient technique for the detection of chromosomal imbalances. Characteristics of these DNA copy number aberrations provide the insights into cancer, and they are useful for the diagnostic and therapy strategies. In this article, we propose a statistical bivariate model for aCGH data in the stationary wavelet packet transform (SWPT) and apply this bivariate shrinkage estimator into the aCGH smoothing study. Because our new dependent Laplacian bivariate shrinkage estimator covers the dependency between wavelet coefficients and the shift invariant SWPT results include both low- and high-frequency information, our dependent Laplacian bivariate shrinkage estimator based SWPT method (named as SWPT-LaBi) has fundamental advantages to solve aCGH data smoothing problem compared to other methods. In our experiments, two standard evaluation methods, the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, are calculated to demonstrate the performance of our method. In all experimental results, our SWPT-LaBi method outperforms the previous most commonly used aCGH smoothing algorithms on both synthetic data and real data. Meantime, we also propose a new synthetic data generation method for aCGH smoothing algorithms evaluation.

AB  - The study of functional Brain-Heart Interplay (BHI) from non-invasive recordings has gained much interest in recent years. Previous endeavors aimed at understanding how the two dynamical systems exchange information, providing novel holistic biomarkers and important insights on essential cognitive aspects and neural system functioning. However, the interplay between cardiac sympathovagal and cortical oscillations still has much room for further investigation. In this study, we introduce a new computational framework for a functional BHI assessment, namely the Sympatho-Vagal Synthetic Data Generation Model, combining cortical (electroencephalography, EEG) and peripheral (cardiac sympathovagal) neural dynamics. The causal, bidirectional neural control on heartbeat dynamics was quantified on data gathered from 26 human volunteers undergoing a cold-pressor test. Results show that thermal stress induces heart-to-brain functional interplay sustained by EEG oscillations in the delta and gamma bands, primarily originating from sympathetic activity, whereas brain-to-heart interplay originates over central brain regions through sympathovagal control. The proposed methodology provides a viable computational tool for the functional assessment of the causal interplay between cortical and cardiac neural control.

AB  - BackgroundMachine learning (ML) has made a significant impact in medicine and cancer research; however, its impact in these areas has been undeniably slower and more limited than in other application domains. A major reason for this has been the lack of availability of patient data to the broader ML research community, in large part due to patient privacy protection concerns. High-quality, realistic, synthetic datasets can be leveraged to accelerate methodological developments in medicine. By and large, medical data is high dimensional and often categorical. These characteristics pose multiple modeling challenges.MethodsIn this paper, we evaluate three classes of synthetic data generation approaches; probabilistic models, classification-based imputation models, and generative adversarial neural networks. Metrics for evaluating the quality of the generated synthetic datasets are presented and discussed.ResultsWhile the results and discussions are broadly applicable to medical data, for demonstration purposes we generate synthetic datasets for cancer based on the publicly available cancer registry data from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program. Specifically, our cohort consists of breast, respiratory, and non-solid cancer cases diagnosed between 2010 and 2015, which includes over 360,000 individual cases.ConclusionsWe discuss the trade-offs of the different methods and metrics, providing guidance on considerations for the generation and usage of medical synthetic data.

AB  - In a smart environment like the smart grids, it is necessary to have knowledge models that allow solving emerging problems. However, large datasets are required to automatically create these models, which in the vast majority of cases are not available. Therefore, in these environments is essential to have a data generator for each context. In this paper, we propose a synthetic data generation system based on the variational autoencoder (VAE) technique and linked data paradigm, to create larger datasets from small datasets acting as samples. Specifically, a Linked Data-based dataset extractor is proposed, which allows obtaining samples of data in a particular context. Then, a VAE is trained with these samples of data available in a specific context, to learn the latent distribution that characterizes the dataset, allowing the production of new records that are similar to those of the original dataset. Finally, several case studies in the field of energy management are carried out. In one of them, the process that follows our approach is described in detail; and then, another 3 more are considered to evaluate its ability to automate the data generation process for smart energy management. The results show how our synthetic data generation system can be used to obtain synthetic datasets in different energy contexts.

A de-noising diffusion model is applied to the atmospheric correction problem. In place of true noise, the model is trained based on predictions from the physics-based atmospheric radiative transfer tool, MODTRAN, to constrain the training environment. In this paper, we present results from a trained diffusion-based neural network model applied to hyperspectral image data and assess performance compared to conventional empirical atmospheric correction algorithms.

AB  - The application of machine learning to a task often necessitates the production of synthetic training data. Some tasks involve rare, but important, scenarios that may not yet have been observed; others are difficult to collect or annotate in large volumes. These difficulties are particularly acute in computer vision applications to scientific imagery, in which human annotation is complicated by noise, ambiguity, and interpretation. One such application is the detection of Resident Space Objects (RSOs) in electro-optical images for Space Domain Awareness (SDA). In many cases, the mislabeling of RSOs by an imperfect annotator (human or machine) can be detrimental to machine learning model performance, especially when the signal-to-noise (SNR) is near or below human detection levels. In this work we introduce SatSim, a modular electro-optical synthetic data generation engine designed to procedurally generate representative, annotated synthetic electro-optical imagery of remote space scenes. SatSim enables rapid generation of synthetic data through Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) acceleration with TensorFlow. This paper discusses the use of SatSim to enhance machine learning approaches and reports the performance of models trained with real data, synthetic data, and real data augmented with synthetic RSOs. In addition, we explore using SatSim to evaluate current state-of-the-art RSO detection algorithms with new sensors (such as all-sky and event-based) and rare but critically important scenarios (such as satellite breakups and collisions) for which limited real data are available.

AB  - Although a plethora of synthetic data generation models have been proposed to validate biomarkers of brain and cardiovascular dynamics separately, a limited number of computational methods estimating directed brain-heart information flow are currently available in the scientific literature. This study introduces a computational framework exploiting existing generative models for a novel time-resolved quantification of causal brain-heart interplay. Exemplarily, having electroencephalographic signals and heart rate variability series as inputs, respective synthetic data models are coupled through parametrised functions defined in accordance with current central autonomic network (CAN) knowledge. We validate this concept using data from 30 healthy volunteers undergoing notable sympathetic elicitation through a cold-pressor test, and further compare the obtained results with a state-of-the-art method as maximal information coefficient. Although our findings are in agreement with previous CAN findings, we report new insights into the role of fronto-parietal region activity and lateralisation mechanisms over the temporal cortices during prolonged peripheral elicitation, which occur with specific time delays. Additionally, the afferent autonomic outflow maps to brain oscillations in the and bands, whereas complementary cortical dynamics in the , , and bands act on efferent autonomic control. The proposed framework paves the way towards novel biomarker definitions for the assessment of complex physiological networks using existing data generation models for brain and peripheral dynamics.

AB  - This work provides a solution to the challenge of small amounts of training data in Non-Destructive Ultrasonic Testing for composite components. It was demonstrated that direct simulation alone is ineffective at producing training data that was representative of the experimental domain due to poor noise reconstruction. Therefore, four unique synthetic data generation methods were proposed which use semi-analytical simulated data as a foundation. Each method was evaluated for its performance in the classification of real experimental images when trained on a Convolutional Neural Network which underwent hyperparameter optimization using a genetic algorithm. The first method introduced task specific modifications to CycleGAN, a generative network for image -to-image translation, to learn the mapping from physics-based simulations of defect indications to experimental indications in resulting ultrasound images. The second method was based on combining real experimental defect free images with simulated defect responses. The final two methods fully simulated the noise responses at an image and signal level respectively. The purely simulated data produced a mean classification F1 score of 0.394. However, when trained on the new synthetic datasets, a significant improvement in classification performance on experimental data was realized, with mean classification F1 scores of 0.843, 0.688, 0.629, and 0.738 for the respective approaches.

AB  - Human poses and the behaviour estimation for different activities in (virtual reality/augmented reality) VR/AR could have numerous beneficial applications. Human fall monitoring is especially important for elderly people and for non-typical activities with VR/AR applications. There are a lot of different approaches to improving the fidelity of fall monitoring systems through the use of novel sensors and deep learning architectures; however, there is still a lack of detail and diverse datasets for training deep learning fall detectors using monocular images. The issues with synthetic data generation based on digital human simulation were implemented and examined using the Unreal Engine. The proposed pipeline provides automatic "playback" of various scenarios for digital human behaviour simulation, and the result of a proposed modular pipeline for synthetic data generation of digital human interaction with the 3D environments is demonstrated in this paper. We used the generated synthetic data to train the Mask R-CNN-based segmentation of the falling person interaction area. It is shown that, by training the model with simulation data, it is possible to recognize a falling person with an accuracy of 97.6% and classify the type of person's interaction impact. The proposed approach also allows for covering a variety of scenarios that can have a positive effect at a deep learning training stage in other human action estimation tasks in an VR/AR environment.

AB  - Data-driven algorithms have surpassed traditional techniques in almost every aspect in robotic vision problems. Such algorithms need vast amounts of quality data to be able to work properly after their training process. Gathering and annotating that sheer amount of data in the real world is a time-consuming and error-prone task. These problems limit scale and quality. Synthetic data generation has become increasingly popular since it is faster to generate and automatic to annotate. However, most of the current datasets and environments lack realism, interactions, and details from the real world. UnrealROX is an environment built over Unreal Engine 4 which aims to reduce that reality gap by leveraging hyperrealistic indoor scenes that are explored by robot agents which also interact with objects in a visually realistic manner in that simulated world. Photorealistic scenes and robots are rendered by Unreal Engine into a virtual reality headset which captures gaze so that a human operator can move the robot and use controllers for the robotic hands; scene information is dumped on a per-frame basis so that it can be reproduced offline to generate raw data and ground truth annotations. This virtual reality environment enables robotic vision researchers to generate realistic and visually plausible data with full ground truth for a wide variety of problems such as class and instance semantic segmentation, object detection, depth estimation, visual grasping, and navigation.

AB  - Anonymous network traffic is more pervasive than ever due to the accessibility of services such as virtual private networks (VPN) and The Onion Router (Tor). To address the need to identify and classify this traffic, machine and deep learning solutions have become the standard. However, high performing classifiers often scale poorly when applied to real-world traffic classification due to the heavily skewed nature of network traffic data. Prior research has found synthetic data generation to be effective at alleviating concerns surrounding class imbalance, though a limited number of these techniques have been applied to the domain of anonymous network traffic detection. This work compares the ability of a Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Network (CTGAN), Copula Generative Adversarial Network (CopulaGAN), Variational Autoencoder (VAE), and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to create viable synthetic anonymous network traffic samples. Moreover, we evaluate the performance of several shallow boosting and bagging classifiers as well as deep learning models on the synthetic data. Ultimately, we amalgamate the data generated by the GANs, VAE, and SMOTE into a comprehensive dataset dubbed CMU-SynTraffic-2022 for future research on this topic. Our findings show that SMOTE consistently outperformed the other upsampling techniques, improving classifiers' F1-scores over the control by similar to 7.5% for application type characterization. Among the tested classifiers, Light Gradient Boosting Machine achieved the highest F1-score of 90.3% on eight application types.

AB  - This study addresses the challenge of class imbalance in sentiment analysis by utilizing synthetic data to balance training datasets. We introduce an innovative approach using the GPT-3 model's sentence-by-sentence generation technique to generate synthetic data, specifically targeting underrepresented negative and neutral sentiments. Our method aims to align these minority classes with the predominantly positive sentiment class in a Coursera course review dataset, with the goal of enhancing the performance of sentiment classification. This research demonstrates that our proposed method successfully enhances sentiment classification performance, as evidenced by improved accuracy and F1-score metrics across five deep-learning models. However, when compared to our previous research utilizing fine-tuning techniques, the current method shows a relative shortfall. The fine-tuning approach yields better results in all models tested, indicating the importance of data novelty and diversity in synthetic data generation. In terms of the deep-learning model used for classification, the notable finding is the significant performance improvement of the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model compared to other models like CNN, LSTM, BiLSTM, and GRU, highlighting the impact of the model choice and architecture depth. This study emphasizes the critical role of synthetic data quality and strategic deep-learning model implementation in sentiment analysis. The results suggest that the careful consideration of training data and model attributes is vital for optimal sentiment classification.

AB  - Government agencies respond to policies on open government data and develop the innovation of services by releasing structured microdata. Before release, privacy protection is necessary to mitigate privacy disclosure risks. Synthetic Data Generation technique has attracted more and more attention in the field of privacy protection. The limitations of synthesizing comprehensive data are imposed owing to the nature of isolated government microdata. To release synthetic microdata from multiple government departments while keeping each department's control over its local data, a framework for releasing privacy-preserving synthetic data is established, and a Bayesian network-based approach GovSynBayes is proposed. Firstly, the count histograms of multidimensional attributes from multi-department data sources are generated through federated queries. Secondly, the histograms are utilized to construct differentially private Bayesian networks. Finally, the synthesized microdata is sampled and released via the generated private Bayesian networks. It is validated that the exponential mechanism is superior for private network learning compared to the Laplace mechanism. A privacy budget allocation algorithm named consistent signal-to-noise for private distribution learning is proposed, which efficiently reduces the average variation distance between synthetic data and original data. GovSynBayes has been experimentally evaluated on four real government micro-datasets. Compared with the currently popular private synthesizers, GovSynBayes has better computational efficiency and generates synthetic dataset with better attribute correlation and machine learning utility.

AB  - Purpose: Tracking of tools and surgical activity is becoming more and more important in the context of computer assisted surgery. In this work, we present a data generation framework, dataset and baseline methods to facilitate further research in the direction of markerless hand and instrument pose estimation in realistic surgical scenarios. Methods: We developed a rendering pipeline to create inexpensive and realistic synthetic data for model pretraining. Subsequently, we propose a pipeline to capture and label real data with hand and object pose ground truth in an experimental setup to gather high-quality real data. We furthermore present three state-of-the-art RGB-based pose estimation baselines. Results: We evaluate three baseline models on the proposed datasets. The best performing baseline achieves an average tool 3D vertex error of 16.7 mm on synthetic data as well as 13.8 mm on real data which is comparable to the state-of-the art in RGB-based hand/object pose estimation. Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first synthetic and real data generation pipelines to generate hand and object pose labels for open surgery. We present three baseline models for RGB based object and object/hand pose estimation based on RGB frames. Our realistic synthetic data generation pipeline may contribute to overcome the data bottleneck in the surgical domain and can easily be transferred to other medical applications.

AB  - High-quality tabular data is a crucial requirement for developing data-driven applications, especially healthcare-related ones, because most of the data nowadays collected in this context is in tabular form. However, strict data protection laws complicates the access to medical datasets. Thus, synthetic data has become an ideal alternative for data scientists and healthcare professionals to circumvent such hurdles. Although many healthcare institutions still use the classical de-identification and anonymization techniques for generating synthetic data, deep learning-based generative models such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) have shown a remarkable performance in generating tabular datasets with complex structures. This paper examines the GANs' potential and applicability within the healthcare industry, which often faces serious challenges with insufficient training data and patient records sensitivity. We investigate several state-of-the-art GAN-based models proposed for tabular synthetic data generation. Healthcare datasets with different sizes, numbers of variables, column data types, feature distributions, and inter-variable correlations are examined. Moreover, a comprehensive evaluation framework is defined to evaluate the quality of the synthetic records and the viability of each model in preserving the patients' privacy. The results indicate that the proposed models can generate synthetic datasets that maintain the statistical characteristics, model compatibility and privacy of the original data. Moreover, synthetic tabular healthcare datasets can be a viable option in many data-driven applications. However, there is still room for further improvements in designing a perfect architecture for generating synthetic tabular data.

AB  - To obtain lower inference latency and less memory footprint of deep neural networks, model quantization has been widely employed in deep model deployment, by converting the floating points to low-precision integers. However, previous methods (such as quantization aware training and post training quantization) require original data for the fine-tuning or calibration of quantized model, which makes them inapplicable to the cases that original data are not accessed due to privacy or security. This gives birth to the data-free quantization method with synthetic data generation. While current data-free quantization methods still suffer from severe performance degradation when quantizing a model into lower bit, caused by the low inter-class separability of semantic features. To this end, we propose a new and effective data-free quantization method termed ClusterQ, which utilizes the feature distribution alignment for synthetic data generation. To obtain high inter-class separability of semantic features, we cluster and align the feature distribution statistics to imitate the distribution of real data, so that the performance degradation is alleviated. Moreover, we incorporate the diversity enhancement to solve class-wise mode collapse. We also employ the exponential moving average to update the centroid of each cluster for further feature distribution improvement. Extensive experiments based on different deep models (e.g., ResNet-18 and MobileNet-V2) over the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our proposed ClusterQ model obtains state-of-the-art performance.

AB  - Fault prognosis is an important area of research that aims to predict and diagnose faults in complex systems. The sudden failure of industrial components can have adverse consequences for an organisation in terms of time, cost and workflow. It is, therefore, critical to ensure the maintenance of equipment components in optimal condition in order to avoid downtime that may cause significant disruption. Due to this reason, in recent years, there has been an increasing interest in creating innovative methods for fault prognosis that can increase system reliability and reduce maintenance costs. Gear pumps are widely utilised in a variety of industrial applications, and their reliability and effectiveness are crucial for achieving optimal system performance. Gear pumps, on the other hand, are prone to malfunctions and failures, which can result in substantial downtime and maintenance costs. The challenge is to develop a fault prognosis approach that is reliable and accurate enough to detect and diagnose defects in a gear pump before they cause system failures. This paper proposes a novel computational strategy for the fault prognosis of an external gear pump using Machine Learning (ML) approaches. Due to the unavailability of sufficient experimental data in the vicinity of failure mechanisms, a novel approach to generating a high-fidelity in-silico dataset via a Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) model of the gear pump in healthy and faulty working conditions is presented. However, considering the computational demand for rerunning the same CFD simulations, novel synthetic data generation techniques are implemented by perturbing the frequency content of the time series to recreate other working conditions and constructing degradation behaviour using linear and cubic interpolation methods for run-to-failure scenarios. The synthetically created datasets are used to train the underlying ML metamodel for fault prognosis. Two types of ML algorithms are employed for fault prognosis: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. A series of numerical examples are shown, allowing us to infer that the proposed modelling technique is feasible in an industrial setting and that employing the MLP algorithm delivers superior fault prognosis results when compared to SVM. Furthermore, datasets generated using the cubic interpolation method have lower prediction errors than datasets generated using the linear interpolation method due to the smoother degradation behaviour in the data. & COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Pneumatic systems repeat the identical programmed sequence during their operation. The data was collected when the pneumatic system worked perfectly and had some faults including empty magazine, zero vacuum, inappropriate material, no pressure, closed manual pressure valve, missing drilling stroke, poorly located material, not vacuuming the material and low air pressure. The signals of eight sensors were collected during the entire sequence and the 24 most descriptive features of the data were encoded to present to the ANNs. A synthetic data generation process was proposed to train and test the ANNs better when signals are extremely repetitive from one sequence to other. Two artificial neural networks (ANN) were used for interpretation of the encoded signals. The tested ANNs were Adaptive Resonance Theory 2 (ART2), and Back propagation (Bp). ART2 correctly distinguished the perfect and faulty operations at all the tested vigilance values. It classified 11 faulty and 1 normal modes in seven or eight categories at the best vigilance values. Bp also distinguished perfect and faulty operations without even the slightest uncertainty. In less than 10 cases, it had difficulty identifying the 11 types of possible faults. The average estimation error of the Bp was better than 2.1% of the output range on the test data which was created by deviating the encoded values. The ART2 and Bp performance was found excellent with the proposed encoding and synthetic data generation procedures for extremely repetitive sequential data. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Suicidal ideation detection is a vital research area that holds great potential for improving mental health support systems. However, the sensitivity surrounding suicide-related data poses challenges in accessing large-scale, annotated datasets necessary for training effective machine learning models. To address this limitation, we introduce an innovative strategy that leverages the capabilities of generative AI models, such as ChatGPT, Flan-T5, and Llama, to create synthetic data for suicidal ideation detection. Our data generation approach is grounded in social factors extracted from psychology literature and aims to ensure coverage of essential information related to suicidal ideation. In our study, we benchmarked against state-of-the-art NLP classification models, specifically, those centered around the BERT family structures. When trained on the real-world dataset, UMD, these conventional models tend to yield F1-scores ranging from 0.75 to 0.87. Our synthetic data-driven method, informed by social factors, offers consistent F1-scores of 0.82 for both models, suggesting that the richness of topics in synthetic data can bridge the performance gap across different model complexities. Most impressively, when we combined a mere 30% of the UMD dataset with our synthetic data, we witnessed a substantial increase in performance, achieving an F1-score of 0.88 on the UMD test set. Such results underscore the cost-effectiveness and potential of our approach in confronting major challenges in the field, such as data scarcity and the quest for diversity in data representation.

AB  - Background: At the onset of a pandemic, such as COVID-19, data with proper labeling/attributes corresponding to the new disease might be unavailable or sparse. Machine Learning (ML) models trained with the available data, which is limited in quantity and poor in diversity, will often be biased and inaccurate. At the same time, ML algorithms designed to fight pandemics must have good performance and be developed in a time-sensitive manner. To tackle the challenges of limited data, and label scarcity in the available data, we propose generating conditional synthetic data, to be used alongside real data for developing robust ML models. Methods: We present a hybrid model consisting of a conditional generative flow and a classifier for conditional synthetic data generation. The classifier decouples the feature representation for the condition, which is fed to the flow to extract the local noise. We generate synthetic data by manipulating the local noise with fixed conditional feature representation. We also propose a semi-supervised approach to generate synthetic samples in the absence of labels for a majority of the available data. Results: We performed conditional synthetic generation for chest computed tomography (CT) scans corresponding to normal, COVID-19, and pneumonia afflicted patients. We show that our method significantly outperforms existing models both on qualitative and quantitative performance, and our semi-supervised approach can efficiently synthesize conditional samples under label scarcity. As an example of downstream use of synthetic data, we show improvement in COVID-19 detection from CT scans with conditional synthetic data augmentation.

AB  - An integrated system for processing sensor data has been developed based on novel variational autoencoder (VAE) algorithms with explainability that significantly eases analysis of sensor data. By continuously updating a generative model of the data, the system assists users with minimal artificial intelligence (AI) training or experience to perform data analysis. The system performs an extensive range of integrated machine learning (ML) tasks: anomaly detection, active learning, model-drift detection, synthetic data generation, semi-supervised classification, and counterfactual explanation generation.
   When the system is provided a data schema (map of Booleans, integers, reals, categories, time series, etc.) and data set, it automatically forms a preliminary generative model of the data. The construction of the system is modular, so new data types can be added as necessary. Counterfactually explainable anomaly detection is immediately performed via sparse gradient search. This informs the user how to interactively remove or repair bad records and/or begin labeling records of interest. The addition of labels to the data allows multi-class, semi-supervised, counterfactually explainable classification via the support vector machine embedded hyperplane algorithm (SVM-EH). Once some labels are added, active learning is used to assist further labeling by suggesting data elements that are highly likely to improve classification accuracy, significantly accelerating the labeling process by trading human effort for computational cycles. In production, the system detects when its training is becoming stale and requests retraining.
   Classification accuracy is demonstrated to be comparable to other deep learning systems on benchmark data sets.

AB  - Smart devices equipped with various sensors enable the acquisition of users' behavioral biometrics. These sensor data capture variations in users' interactions with the devices, which can be analyzed to extract valuable information such as user activity, age group, and gender. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of using gait data for gender detection of users. To achieve this, we propose a novel gender detection scheme based on a deep learning approach, incorporating synthetic data generation and continuous wavelet transform (CWT). In this scheme, the real dataset is first divided into training and test datasets, and then synthetic data are intelligently generated using various techniques to augment the existing training data. Subsequently, CWT is used as the feature extraction module, and its outputs are fed into a deep learning model to detect the gender of users. Different deep learning models, including convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM), are employed in classification. Consequently, we evaluate our proposed framework on different publicly available datasets. On the BOUN Sensor dataset, we obtain an accuracy of 94.83%, marking a substantial 6.5% enhancement over the prior highest rate of 88.33%. Additionally, we achieve 86.27% and 88.15% accuracy on the OU-ISIR Android and OU-ISIR Center IMUZ datasets, respectively. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model achieves high detection rates and outperforms previous methods across all datasets.

AB  - In the field of automatic defect detection, a major challenge in training accurate classifiers using supervised learning is the insufficient and limited diversity of datasets. Obtaining an adequate amount of image data depicting defective surfaces in an industrial setting can be costly and time-consuming. Furthermore, the collected dataset may suffer from selection bias, resulting in an underrepresentation of certain defect classes. Our research aims to address surface defect detection in titanium metal spacer rings by introducing an approach leveraging a digital twin framework. The behavior of the digital twin is optimized using a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm. The optimized digital twin is then used to generate synthetic data, which is employed to train a spacer defect detection classifier. The classifier's performance is evaluated using real-world data. The results show that the model trained with synthetic data outperforms the one trained on a limited amount of real data. Our work highlights the potential of digital twin-based synthetic data generation and RL optimization in enhancing spacer surface defect detection and addressing the data scarcity challenge in the field. When the inspection network is trained solely using generated synthetic data, it achieves an inspection precision of 96.10%, with a recall of 85.77%. Incorporating real data alongside synthetic data for training further enhances performance, yielding an inspection precision of 93.07% and a recall of 94.20%. This surpasses the defect detection capabilities observed when training the inspection network exclusively with real data.

AB  - Despite the notable achievements of deep object detection models, a major challenge remains to be the need for vast amounts of training data. The process of acquiring such real-world data is laborious, prompting the exploration of new research directions such as synthetic data generation. In this study, we assess the capability of two distinct synthetic data generating techniques utilising stable diffusion, namely, (1) Prompt engineering of an established model and (2) Fine-tuning a pretrained model. As a result, we generate two training datasets, manually annotate them, and train separate object detection models for testing on a real-world detection dataset. The results demonstrate that both prompt engineering and fine-tuning exhibit similar performance when tested on a set of 331 real-world images, in the context of apple detection in apple orchards. We compared their performance with the baseline setting where the model was trained on real-world images and witnessed only a 0.07 and 0.08 average precision deviation from the baseline model. Qualitative results demonstrate that both models are able to accurately predict the location of the apples, except in instances of heavy shading. This study distinguishes itself from prior research by focusing on object detection instead of image classification. Furthermore, we are the first to apply diffusion model fine-tuning in the context of dataset generation. Our findings underscore the potential of synthetic data generation as a viable alternative to the laborious collection of extensive training data for object detection models.

AB  - The generation of synthetic patient data that reflect the statistical properties of real data plays a fundamental role in today's world because of its potential to (i) be enable proprietary data access for statistical and research purposes and (ii) increase available data (e.g., in low-density regions-i.e., for patients with under-represented characteristics). Generative methods employ a family of solutions for generating synthetic data. The objective of this research is to benchmark numerous state-of-the-art deep-learning generative methods across different scenarios and clinical datasets comprising patient covariates and several pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic endpoints. We did this by implementing various probabilistic models aimed at generating synthetic data, such as the Multi-layer Perceptron Conditioning Generative Adversarial Neural Network (MLP cGAN), Time-series Generative Adversarial Networks (TimeGAN), and a more traditional approach like Probabilistic Autoregressive (PAR). We evaluated their performance by calculating discriminative and predictive scores. Furthermore, we conducted comparisons between the distributions of real and synthetic data using Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Chi-square statistical tests, focusing respectively on covariate and output variables of the models. Lastly, we employed pharmacometrics-related metric to enhance interpretation of our results specific to our investigated scenarios. Results indicate that multi-layer perceptron-based conditional generative adversarial networks (MLP cGAN) exhibit the best overall performance for most of the considered metrics. This work highlights the opportunities to employ synthetic data generation in the field of clinical pharmacology for augmentation and sharing of proprietary data across institutions.

AB  - Player identification is an essential and complex task in sports video analysis. Different strategies have been devised over the years and identification based on jersey numbers is one of the most common approaches given its versatility and relative simplicity. However, automatic detection of jersey numbers is challenging due to changing camera angles, low video resolution, small object size in wide-range shots, and transient changes in the player's posture and movement. In this paper, we present a novel approach for jersey number identification in a small, highly imbalanced dataset from the Seattle Seahawks practice videos. We generate novel synthetic datasets of different complexities to mitigate the data imbalance and scarcity in the samples. To show the effectiveness of our synthetic data generation, we use a multi-step strategy that enforces attention to a particular region of interest (player's torso), to identify jersey numbers. The solution first identifies and crops players in a frame using a person detection model, then utilizes a human pose estimation model to localize jersey numbers in the detected players, obviating the need for annotating bounding boxes for number detection. We experimented with two sets of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with different learning objectives: multi-class for two-digit number identification and multi-label for digit-wise detection to compare performance. Our experiments indicate that our novel synthetic data generation method improves the accuracy of various CNN models by 9% overall, and 18% on low frequency numbers.

CP  - 30th USENIX Security Symposium
AB  - In differential privacy (DP), a challenging problem is to generate synthetic datasets that efficiently capture the useful information in the private data. The synthetic dataset enables any task to be done without privacy concern and modification to existing algorithms. In this paper, we present PrivSyn, the first automatic synthetic data generation method that can handle general tabular datasets (with 100 attributes and domain size > 2(500)). PrivSyn is composed of a new method to automatically and privately identify correlations in the data, and a novel method to generate sample data from a dense graphic model. We extensively evaluate different methods on multiple datasets to demonstrate the performance of our method.

AB  - We study the sample complexity of private synthetic data generation over an unbounded sized class of statistical queries, and show that any class that is privately proper PAC learnable admits a private synthetic data generator (perhaps non-efficient). Previous work on synthetic data generators focused on the case that the query class D is finite and obtained sample complexity bounds that scale logarithmically with the size vertical bar D vertical bar. Here we construct a private synthetic data generator whose sample complexity is independent of the domain size, and we replace finiteness with the assumption that D is privately PAC learnable (a formally weaker task, hence we obtain equivalence between the two tasks).

AB  - We propose a novel synthetic-benchmarks generation model using partial time-series regression, called Partial-Regression-Integrated Generic Model (PRIGM). PRIGM abstracts the unique characteristics of the input sensor data into generic time-series data confirming the generation similarity and evaluating the correctness of the synthetic benchmarks. The experimental results obtained by the proposed model with its formula verify that PRIGM preserves the time-series characteristics of empirical data in complex time-series data within 10.4% on an average difference in terms of descriptive statistics accuracy.

AB  - Natural Language Processing (NLP) has witnessed a paradigm shift with Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the static knowledge from pre-training can lead to knowledge obsolescence. This study focuses on the dynamic relationship between LLMs and evolving knowledge, using GPT-2 as a case study. Leveraging an existing framework, we update models with monthly Wikipedia dumps and Wikidata probes, addressing the stability-plasticity trade-off. We introduce a novel synthetic data generation method for experimental control and present SMARTREVIEW, a state-of-the-art continual learning method. This work advances understanding and methodologies in tackling knowledge obsolescence in evolving language models.

AB  - Synthetic data generation has become increasingly popular with the increasing use of generative networks. Recently, Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architectures have produced exceptional results in synthetic image generation. However, time series generation still needs to be studied. This paper proposes a Conditional GAN-based system to generate unique samples of non-REM sleep electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. The CGAN model had a 1-D Convolution Neural Network based architecture. The model was trained using real EEG from healthy controls. The trained model can generate an artificial 30-second epoch of non-REM sleep whose power spectrum is identical to that of a real sleep EEG.

AB  - We report that state-of-the-art parsers consistently failed to identify "hers" and "theirs" as pronouns but identified the masculine equivalent "his". We find that the same biases exist in recent language models like BERT. While some of the bias comes from known sources, like training data with gender imbalances, we find that the bias is amplified in the language models and that linguistic differences between English pronouns that are not inherently biased can become biases in some machine learning models. We introduce a new technique for measuring bias in models, using Bayesian approximations to generate partially-synthetic data from the model itself.

AB  - In the era of globalization, traditional theories and models of social systems are shifting their focus from isolation and independence to networks and connectedness. Analyzing these new complex social models is a growing, and computationally demanding area of research. In this study, we investigate the integration of genetic algorithms (GAs) with a random-walk-based distance measure to find subgroups in social networks. We test our approach by synthetically generating realistic social network data sets. Our clustering experiments using random-walk-based distances reveal exceptionally accurate results compared with the experiments using Euclidean distances. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We review recent progress in machine learning (ML) model developments, which have relied heavily on DFT for synthetic data generation and for the design of model architectures. The general relevance of these developments is placed in a broader context for chemical and materials sciences. DFT-based ML models have reached high efficiency, accuracy, scalability, and transferability and pave the way to the routine use of successful experimental planning software within self-driving laboratories.

Test set performance was compared between baseline experiments and experiments that incorporated synthetic training data.ResultsTraining with synthetic raw data showed decreasing reconstruction errors with increasing amounts of training data, but importantly this was magnitude-only data, rather than real raw data. For small training sets, training with synthetic data decreased the mean absolute error (MAE) by up to 7.5%, whereas for larger training sets the MAE increased by up to 2.6%.DiscussionSynthetic raw data generation improved reconstruction quality in scenarios with limited training data. A major advantage of synthetic data generation is that it allows for the reuse of magnitude-only datasets, which are more readily available than raw datasets.

AB  - There is a significant public demand for rapid data-driven scientific investigations using aggregated sensitive information. However, many technical challenges and regulatory policies hinder efficient data sharing. In this study, we describe a partially synthetic data generation technique for creating anonymized data archives whose joint distributions closely resemble those of the original (sensitive) data. Specifically, we introduce the DataSifter technique for time-varying correlated data (DataSifter II), which relies on an iterative model-based imputation using generalized linear mixed model and random effects-expectation maximization tree. DataSifter II can be used to generate synthetic repeated measures data for testing and validating new analytical techniques. Compared to the multiple imputation method, DataSifter II application on simulated and real clinical data demonstrates that the new method provides extensive reduction of re-identification risk (data privacy) while preserving the analytical value (data utility) in the obfuscated data. The performance of the DataSifter II on a simulation involving 20% artificially missingness in the data, shows at least 80% reduction of the disclosure risk, compared to the multiple imputation method, without a substantial impact on the data analytical value. In a separate clinical data (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III) validation, a model-based statistical inference drawn from the original data agrees with an analogous analytical inference obtained using the DataSifter II obfuscated (sifted) data. For large time-varying datasets containing sensitive information, the proposed technique provides an automated tool for alleviating the barriers of data sharing and facilitating effective, advanced, and collaborative analytics.

AB  - Acquiring representative data samples is pivotal to the process of creating machine learning models. However, gathering real-world imagery often presents challenges related to privacy concerns, regulatory constraints, financial resources, and accessibility limitations. Synthetic imagery offers an opportunity to augment real-world computer vision datasets while bypassing these obstacles. Yet, a fundamental challenge in working with synthetic imagery is ensuring that the generated data closely resembles its real-world counterpart. Further, it can be difficult to generate synthetic imagery with the same features and quality required to train well-generalized computer vision models. This research paper introduces and evaluates our custom-built Replicant framework - a novel synthetic data generation framework integrated into Booz Allen's Vision AI Stack. In developing this service, we created a framework to produce synthetic imagery that closely resembles a real-world maritime dataset, and which can be used to develop any domain-specific synthetic data. We utilize this data to train object detection models and demonstrate how synthetic data benefits model performance. Additionally, we employ similarity metrics, including perceptual hashing (pHash), Optimal Transport Datase Distance (OTDD), and Frechet Inception Distance (FID) to assess the likeness of these real and synthetic datasets. Finally, we explore the applicability and effectiveness of explainable AI(XAI) techniques, suchas Eigen Class Activation Mapping (EigenCAM) and Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP), to gain insights into the performance of our deep learning models and the utility of our synthetic data. Our findings underscore the vast potential of synthetic data to benefit deep learning model performance while overcoming challenges associated with real-world data acquisition.

AB  - Pose detection of objects is an important topic in object-level mapping and indoor localization. In the past, pose estimation methods were performed either with the help of artificial markers or natural features found on the object. However, due to the fact that the markers can only be utilized in controlled environment experiments, the application of marker-based approaches is very limited. Furthermore, methods that depend on the object's natural visual features require texture on the object and lack robustness to illumination and camera viewpoint variations.
   With the advent of Deep Learning (DL), the classical pose estimation methods have been outperformed. The DL-based pose estimation can detect deep features of the object and exhibits higher robustness to many distortions and variabilities caused by the changes in the illumination and viewpoint conditions. However, the massive training data set requirement is the main challenge with most DL-based methods. The training set is often a real set of images that have been manually labeled or annotated. In addition, such methods face problems related to the degradation of their predicted accuracy in the presence of uncertainties due to the symmetrical structure of many objects. To address the aforementioned issues, a novel and very fast method for generating synthetic data, as well as a contour-based technique for accurate pose estimation (that can handle pose ambiguities for a symmetrical object) are proposed in this paper. The tests that are conducted in multiple indoor scenarios demonstrate not only the effectiveness of the synthetic data generation but also exhibit, in many cases, the very high accuracy of the proposed pose estimation method.

TI  - Patient-centric synthetic data generation, no reason to risk re-identification in biomedical data analysis
T2  - NPJ DIGITAL MEDICINE
LA  - English
AB  - While nearly all computational methods operate on pseudonymized personal data, re-identification remains a risk. With personal health data, this re-identification risk may be considered a double-crossing of patients' trust. Herein, we present a new method to generate synthetic data of individual granularity while holding on to patients' privacy. Developed for sensitive biomedical data, the method is patient-centric as it uses a local model to generate random new synthetic data, called an "avatar data", for each initial sensitive individual. This method, compared with 2 other synthetic data generation techniques (Synthpop, CT-GAN), is applied to real health data with a clinical trial and a cancer observational study to evaluate the protection it provides while retaining the original statistical information. Compared to Synthpop and CT-GAN, the Avatar method shows a similar level of signal maintenance while allowing to compute additional privacy metrics. In the light of distance-based privacy metrics, each individual produces an avatar simulation that is on average indistinguishable from 12 other generated avatar simulations for the clinical trial and 24 for the observational study. Data transformation using the Avatar method both preserves, the evaluation of the treatment's effectiveness with similar hazard ratios for the clinical trial (original HR = 0.49 [95% CI, 0.39-0.63] vs. avatar HR = 0.40 [95% CI, 0.31-0.52]) and the classification properties for the observational study (original AUC = 99.46 (s.e. 0.25) vs. avatar AUC = 99.84 (s.e. 0.12)). Once validated by privacy metrics, anonymous synthetic data enable the creation of value from sensitive pseudonymized data analyses by tackling the risk of a privacy breach.

AB  - Syntheticdata is becoming the way forward to manage legal and regulatory aspects of biomedical research involving personal and clinical data. As no matches are expected between artificial instances and real samples and/or subjects, external researchers performing secondary analyses could benefit significantly by having unlimited access to uncompromised information. In this context, one of the main objectives of the 112020 VITALISE project is to develop a platform for providing synthetic data generated from real data collected in Living Labs to those external researchers. in addition, while some time series specific synthetic data generation models exist, only a few of them consider metadata (e.g., patient demographics) as part of the time series generation process itself. Therefore, the objective of this research is to perform a comparative assessment of two synthetic data generation models that use and process the metadata of subjects differently: The Wasserstein CAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) and the DOppelGANger (DGAN). To achieve this goal making sure the analyses were data-independent, we selected two healthcare -related longitudinal datasets: (1) Treadmill Maximal Effort Test (TMET) measurements from the University of Malaga; and (2) a hypotension subset derived from the MIMIC -Ill v1.4 database. After synthetic data was generated, we assessed three pivotal aspects: resemblance to the original data, utility, and level of privacy. As a main conclusion, the importance of using metadata as context variables and the methodology to take them into account was proved to be significant and valuable, the DEAN model offering better results overall.A more extensive time series specific evaluation is left as the main avenuefor future research.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to generate synthetic electronic health records (EHRs). The generated EHR data will be more realistic than those generated using the existing medical Generative Adversarial Network (medGAN) method.
   Materials and Methods: We modified medGAN to obtain two synthetic data generation models-designated as medical Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (medWGAN) and medical boundary-seeking GAN (medBGAN)-and compared the results obtained using the three models. We used 2 databases: MIMIC-III and National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), Taiwan. First, we trained the models and generated synthetic EHRs by using these three 3 models. We then analyzed and compared the models' performance by using a few statistical methods (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, dimension-wise probability for binary data, and dimension-wise average count for count data) and 2 machine learning tasks (association rule mining and prediction).
   Results: We conducted a comprehensive analysis and found our models were adequately efficient for generating synthetic EHR data. The proposed models outperformed medGAN in all cases, and among the 3 models, boundary-seeking GAN (medBGAN) performed the best.
   Discussion: To generate realistic synthetic EHR data, the proposed models will be effective in the medical industry and related research from the viewpoint of providing better services. Moreover, they will eliminate barriers including limited access to EHR data and thus accelerate research on medical informatics.
   Conclusion: The proposed models can adequately learn the data distribution of real EHRs and efficiently generate realistic synthetic EHRs. The results show the superiority of our models over the existing model.

AB  - Pneumonia, a significant contributor to global disease and mortality, imposes a substantial burden on healthcare systems. Conventional approaches to pneumonia detection rely on constrained datasets and traditional feature extraction techniques, potentially resulting in suboptimal accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the "SyntDiaNet" framework, an innovative solution that amalgamates synthetic data generation and advanced diagnostic capabilities. This research presents a comprehensive methodology aimed at enhancing pneumonia detection precision. The central innovation revolves around the integration of a Classifier-Embedded Generative Adversarial Network (CE-GAN) for data augmentation, followed by a multifaceted feature extraction process. This process encompasses Contour Detection, Gabor Texture Analysis, and Blob Detection, to capture nuanced patterns that may indicate pneumonia in X-ray images. Leveraging broad knowledge, an unsupervised feature extraction step is integrated using the SyntDiaNet Transfer Learning model. Across diverse feature extraction strategies, combined with the CE-GAN dataset and SyntDiaNet model, accuracy rates demonstrate substantial improvements, with potential ranges of 90.5% to 97.6%. The precision ranged between 0.932 and 0.981; recall scores spanned from 0.896 to 0.987; F1 scores varied between 0.90 and 0.980, and the AUC-ROC values ranged from 0.90 to 0.97, showcasing the ability of the models to discriminate between positive and negative classes, emphasizing differences in the classifiers' overall performance in ranking instances. By utilizing synthetic data and advanced feature extraction techniques, it adeptly addresses challenges related to limited datasets and imbalanced class distributions. Furthermore, its adaptability to various medical imaging tasks underscores its potential impact across a range of healthcare applications.

TI  - Bt-GAN: Generating Fair Synthetic Healthdata via Bias-transforming Generative Adversarial Networks
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH
LA  - English
AB  - Synthetic data generation offers a promising solution to enhance the usefulness of Electronic Healthcare Records (EHR) by generating realistic de-identified data. However, the existing literature primarily focuses on the quality of synthetic health data, neglecting the crucial aspect of fairness in downstream predictions. Consequently, models trained on synthetic EHR have faced criticism for producing biased outcomes in target tasks. These biases can arise from either spurious correlations between features or the failure of models to accurately represent sub-groups. To address these concerns, we present Bias-transforming Generative Adversarial Networks (Bt-GAN), a GAN-based synthetic data generator specifically designed for the healthcare domain. In order to tackle spurious correlations (i), we propose an information-constrained Data Generation Process (DGP) that enables the generator to learn a fair deterministic transformation based on a well-defined notion of algorithmic fairness. To overcome the challenge of capturing exact sub-group representations (ii), we incentivize the generator to preserve sub-group densities through score-based weighted sampling. This approach compels the generator to learn from underrepresented regions of the data manifold. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) database. Our results demonstrate that Bt-GAN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while significantly improving fairness and minimizing bias amplification. Furthermore, we perform an in-depth explainability analysis to provide additional evidence supporting the validity of our study. In conclusion, our research introduces a novel and professional approach to addressing the limitations of synthetic data generation in the healthcare domain. By incorporating fairness considerations and leveraging advanced techniques such as GANs, we pave the way for more reliable and unbiased predictions in healthcare applications.

AB  - Seismic fault interpretation is a crucial task for hydrocarbon reservoir characterization, CO2 geological storage, and geothermal energy evaluation. Deep learning (DL)-based methods have been conducted to accelerate seismic fault interpretation and studies have shown that the most practicable way is to train neural networks using synthetic data with ground truth labels. However, synthetic and field data are different in local seismic structures, seismic reflection characteristics, and seismic fault features. These differences would lead to the poor generalization of DL-based methods and unreliable fault predictions. We propose an automatic fault interpretation method with the aid of the data-, physics-, and math-assisted synthetic data generation, including the data-assisted module, the physics-assisted module, and the math-assisted module. The data-assisted module provides structural features and reflection characteristics of seismic events. The physics-assisted module provides seismic fault features from physical experiments. The math-assisted module generates realistic synthetic data and ground truth fault labels based on the extracted features. We then propose the multiscale attention-based convolutional neural network (MSACNN), by combining a simplified deeplab module and attention mechanism. Finally, we train the MSACNN using the generated synthetic dataset. To illustrate the validity and generalization of the proposed model, we apply it to synthetic data and two 3-D real seismic volumes. The superiority of the proposed method is experimentally demonstrated with the qualitative and quantitative comparisons of fault interpretation results using different methods.

AB  - With the rise in usage of computer networks across the globe, large amounts of data are being generated which has raised the need for robust intrusion detection systems to monitor the network traffic. Organizations are leveraging the predictive power of machine learning and deep learning models to develop robust IDS which can alarm any illicit intrusion. However, the power of deep neural networks is often constrained by the availability of training data. In real-world scenarios where the acquisition of large training datasets is not possible, synthetic data generation is emerging as a promising alternative. Conditional GAN allows us to condition the network with additional information such as class labels and generate data resembling the input class. The limitation of this architecture is that it works with a single label and doesn't allow mixing of labels to create newer varieties of data. We propose Blender-GAN, a generative adversarial network, that takes multiple class labels and their respective proportions to generate a novel output that represents all input classes in the input proportions. Unlike traditional GANs two discriminators are used, one traditional Real/Fake classifier and another to control the class of generated data. During the new data generation phase, multiple classes are blended in defined proportions which creates new data with characteristics of the classes in the specified ratio. The proposed architecture was implemented for generating synthetic network intrusion data, using various proportions of different known attack classes. The Blender-GAN output generated new attack classes, which resembled realistic network data.

AB  - PURPOSE In artificial intelligence-based modeling, working with a limited number of patient groups is challenging. This retrospective study aimed to evaluate whether applying synthetic data generation methods to the clinical data of small patient groups can enhance the performance of prediction models. MATERIALS AND METHODS A data set collected by the Cancer Registry Library Project from the Yonsei Cancer Center (YCC), Severance Hospital, between January 2008 and October 2020 was reviewed. Patients with colorectal cancer younger than 50 years who started their initial treatment at YCC were included. A Bayesian network-based synthesizing model was used to generate a synthetic data set, combined with the differential privacy (DP) method. RESULTS A synthetic population of 5,005 was generated from a data set of 1,253 patients with 93 clinical features. The Hellinger distance and correlation difference metric were below 0.3 and 0.5, respectively, indicating no statistical difference. The overall survival by disease stage did not differ between the synthetic and original populations. Training with the synthetic data and validating with the original data showed the highest performances of 0.850, 0.836, and 0.790 for the Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost models, respectively. Comparison of synthetic data sets with different epsilon parameters from the original data sets showed improved performance >0.1%. For extremely small data sets, models using synthetic data outperformed those using only original data sets. The reidentification risk measures demonstrated that the epsilons between 0.1 and 100 fell below the baseline, indicating a preserved privacy state. CONCLUSION The synthetic data generation approach enhances predictive modeling performance by maintaining statistical and clinical integrity, and simultaneously reduces privacy risks through the application of DP techniques.

AB  - In this work we focus on identifying healthy brain slices vs brain slices with Multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions. MS is an autoimmune, demyelinating disease characterized by inflammatory lesions in the central nervous system.(1) MRI is commonly used for diagnosis of MS, and enables accurate detection and classification of lesions for early diagnosis and treatment.(2) Visual attention mechanisms may be beneficial for the detection of MS brain lesions, as they tend to be small. The attention mechanism prevents overfitting of the background when the amount of data is limited. In addition, enough data is necessary for training a successful machine learning algorithms for medical image analysis. Data with insufficient variability(3) leads to poor classification performance. This is problematic in medical imaging where abnormal findings are uncommon and data labeling requires expensive expert's time.
   In this work, we suggest a new network architecture, based on Y-net(4) and EfficientNet(5) models, with attention layers to improve the network performance and reduce overfitting. Furthermore, the attention layers allow extraction of lesion locations. In addition, we show an innovative regularization scheme on the attention weight mask to make it focus on the lesions while letting it search in different areas. Finally, we explore an option to add synthetic lesions in the training process. Based on recent work,19 we generate artificial lesions in healthy brain MRI scans to augment our training data. Our system achieves 91% accuracy in identifying cases that contain lesions (vs. healthy cases) with more than 13% improvement over an equivalent system without the attention and the data added.

AB  - With the emergence of AI(artificial intelligence), it is becoming more and more critical for organizations to utilize it to their advantage. However, organizations that possess a decent amount of data might not have the technical competence to perform machine learning, and vice versa. Hence, it is reasonable for the two kinds of organizations to work together to realize the value of the data. With the increasing concern over data privacy, regulations such as GDPR(General Data Protection Regulation) prevent an organization from sharing data with another unless the data is processed to the point that the individuals in the data are not identifiable. Various ways of data anonymization have been proposed and developed, including the ones that utilize neural networks to achieve the goal, like AE, VAE, and GAN. With the addition of a differential privacy framework like TensorFlow Privacy, privacy can be guaranteed, but data still needs to be usable after privacy protection measures are deployed. The present study aims to integrate TensorFlow Privacy into the synthetic data generation process and evaluate its usefulness for daily use in the industries. Since TensorFlow Privacy brings a provable privacy guarantee to synthetic data, the present study focuses on the evaluation of data utility. TensorFlow is widely used for machine learning in the industry and academically. TensorFlow Privacy, which is also developed by Google, can prove to be a valuable addition to the synthetic data generation pipeline. The result shows that VAE with TensorFlow Privacy 1) generates synthetic data with good data utility in most cases in terms of descriptive statistics and machine learning classification tasks, and 2) The customizable TensorFlow Privacy parameters work as intended in terms of privacy-utility trade-off.

KW  - FRAMEWORK
AB  - Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising method to protect patient privacy while sharing individual-level health data. Intuitively, sharing synthetic data should reduce disclosure risks because no explicit linkage is retained between the synthetic records and the real data upon which it is based. However, the risks associated with synthetic data are still evolving, and what seems protected today may not be tomorrow. In this paper, we show that membership inference attacks, whereby an adversary infers if the data from certain target individuals (known to the adversary a priori) were relied upon by the synthetic data generation process, can be substantially enhanced through state-of-the-art machine learning frameworks, which calls into question the protective nature of existing synthetic data generators. Specifically, we formulate the membership inference problem from the perspective of the data holder, who aims to perform a disclosure risk assessment prior to sharing any health data. To support such an assessment, we introduce a framework for effective membership inference against synthetic health data without specific assumptions about the generative model or a welldefined data structure, leveraging the principles of contrastive representation learning. To illustrate the potential for such an attack, we conducted experiments against synthesis approaches using two datasets derived from several health data resources (Vanderbilt University Medical Center, the All of Us Research Program) to determine the upper bound of risk brought by an adversary who invokes an optimal strategy. The results indicate that partially synthetic data are vulnerable to membership inference at a very high rate. By contrast, fully synthetic data are only marginally susceptible and, in most cases, could be deemed sufficiently protected from membership inference.

AB  - One major barrier to advancing aerial autonomy has been collecting large-scale aerial datasets for training machine learning models. Due to costly and time-consuming real-world data collection through deploying drones, there has been an increasing shift towards using synthetic data for training models in drone applications. However, to increase widespread generalization and transferring models to real-world, increasing the diversity of simulation environments to train a model over all the varieties and augmenting the training data, has been proved to be essential. Current synthetic aerial data generation tools either lack data augmentation or rely heavily on manual workload or real samples for configuring and generating diverse realistic simulation scenes for data collection. These dependencies limit scalability of the data generation workflow. Accordingly, there is a major challenge in balancing generalizability and scalability in synthetic data generation. To address these gaps, we introduce a scal-able Aerial Synthetic Data Augmentation (ASDA) framework tailored to aerial autonomy applications. ASDA extends a central data collection engine with two scriptable pipelines that automatically perform scene and data augmentations to generate diverse aerial datasets for different training tasks. ASDA improves data generation workflow efficiency by providing a unified prompt-based interface over integrated pipelines for flexible control. The procedural generative approach of our data augmentation is performant and adaptable to different simulation environments, training tasks and data collection needs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in automatically generating diverse datasets and show its potential for downstream performance optimization. Our work contributes to generating enhanced benchmark datasets for training models that can generalize better to real-world situations.

AB  - Synthetic data provides a privacy protecting mechanism for the broad usage and sharing of healthcare data for secondary purposes. It is considered a safe approach for the sharing of sensitive data as it generates an artificial dataset that contains no identifiable information. Synthetic data is increasing in popularity with multiple synthetic data generators developed in the past decade, yet its utility is still a subject of research. This paper is concerned with evaluating the effect of various synthetic data generation and usage settings on the utility of the generated synthetic data and its derived models. Specifically, we investigate (i) the effect of data pre-processing on the utility of the synthetic data generated, (ii) whether tuning should be applied to the synthetic datasets when generating supervised machine learning models, and (iii) whether sharing preliminary machine learning results can improve the synthetic data models. Lastly, (iv) we investigate whether one utility measure (Propensity score) can predict the accuracy of the machine learning models generated from the synthetic data when employed in real life. We use two popular measures of synthetic data utility, propensity score and classification accuracy, to compare the different settings. We adopt a recent mechanism for the calculation of propensity, which looks carefully into the choice of model for the propensity score calculation. Accordingly, this paper takes a new direction with investigating the effect of various data generation and usage settings on the quality of the generated data and its ensuing models. The goal is to inform on the best strategies to follow when generating and using synthetic data.

AB  - Computer modelling and digitalization are integral to the wind energy sector since they provide tools with which to improve the design and performance of wind turbines, and thus reduce both capital and operational costs. The massive sensor rollout and increase in big data processing capacity over the last decade has made data collection and analysis more efficient, allowing for the development and use of digital twins. This paper presents a methodology for developing a hybrid-model-based digital twin (DT) of a power conversion system of wind turbines. This DT allows knowledge to be acquired from real operation data while preserving physical design relationships, can generate synthetic data from events that never happened, and helps in the detection and classification of different failure conditions. Starting from an initial physics-based model of a wind turbine drivetrain, which is trained with real data, the proposed methodology has two major innovative outcomes. The first innovation aspect is the application of generative stochastic models coupled with a hybrid-model-based digital twin (DT) for the creation of synthetic failure data based on real anomalies observed in SCADA data. The second innovation aspect is the classification of failures based on machine learning techniques, that allows anomaly conditions to be identified in the operation of the wind turbine. Firstly, technique and methodology were contrasted and validated with operation data of a real wind farm owned by Engie, including labelled failure conditions. Although the selected use case technology is based on a double-fed induction generator (DFIG) and its corresponding partial-scale power converter, the methodology could be applied to other wind conversion technologies.

AB  - A large and diversified dataset is the cornerstone for the analysis of many real world systems. Data collection, especially involving living beings, is a time and effort consuming approach. Data augmentation using analytical models is gaining traction in computing systems because of data scarcity in real world applications. In this paper, we demonstrate a case study of data explosion for radar based human gesture detection. We present a physical model based simulation framework for obtaining radar signals corresponding to different human gestures. Radar based public datasets have not yet been so easily available because of its high cost and less availability. On the contrary, Kinect based datasets are easily available because of its market dominance and commercialization of devices such as Xbox Kinect. Thus, for the simulation framework, we have used the publicly available dataset for gaming gestures based on Kinect data (obtained from Microsoft Cambridge joint initiative). This Kinect data containing the coordinates of joint positions of human skeletons performing different gaming gestures is then fed to a radar based simulation framework to calculate the radar data. Furthermore, we have tuned different parameters in this simulation framework and exploded it to generate radar micro Doppler signatures in a controlled way, keeping in mind the physical constraints. On this exploded data, machine learning algorithms have been applied to evaluate gesture detection accuracy. The enlarged dataset for four gestures has shown an accuracy of around 94.7 % for 10 fold cross validation in training phase. A comparison of simulated radar data with respect to experimentally obtained hardware radar data for different gestures has also been reported to show the relevance of the proposed method.

AB  - Nowadays, data is king and if treated and used properly it promises to give organizations a competitive edge over rivals by enabling them to develop and design Intelligent Systems to improve their services. However, they need to fully comply with not only ethical but also regulatory obligations, where, e.g., privacy (strictly) needs to be respected when using or sharing data, thus protecting both the interests of users and organizations. Fraud Detection systems are examples of such systems where Machine Learning algorithms leverage information to classify financial transactions as legitimate or illicit. The data used to create these solutions is usually highly structured and contains categorical and continuous features characterised by complex distributions. One of the main challenges of fraud detection is concerned with the scarcity of fraudulent instances which results in highly unbalanced datasets. Additionally, privacy is crucial, and it is usually forbidden, or not possible, to share the data of organizations and individuals for creating or improving models.In this paper we propose a framework for private data sharing based on synthetic data generation using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) that learns the specificities of financial transactions data and generates fictitious data that keeps the utility of the original datasets. Our proposal, called Duo-GAN, uses two GAN generators to handle the data imbalance problem, one generator for fraudulent instances and the other for legitimate instances. With this approach, we observed, at most, a 5% disparity in F1 scores between classifiers trained and tested with actual data and the ones trained with synthetic data and tested with actual data.

AB  - Background: A regular task by developers and users of synthetic data generation (SDG) methods is to evaluate and compare the utility of these methods. Multiple utility metrics have been proposed and used to evaluate synthetic data. However, they have not been validated in general or for comparing SDG methods.
   Objective: This study evaluates the ability of common utility metrics to rank SDG methods according to performance on a specific analytic workload. The workload of interest is the use of synthetic data for logistic regression prediction models, which is a very frequent workload in health research.
   Methods: We evaluated 6 utility metrics on 30 different health data sets and 3 different SDG methods (a Bayesian network, a Generative Adversarial Network, and sequential tree synthesis). These metrics were computed by averaging across 20 synthetic data sets from the same generative model. The metrics were then tested on their ability to rank the SDG methods based on prediction performance. Prediction performance was defined as the difference between each of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and area under the precision-recall curve values on synthetic data logistic regression prediction models versus real data models.
   Results: The utility metric best able to rank SDG methods was the multivariate Hellinger distance based on a Gaussian copula representation of real and synthetic joint distributions.
   Conclusions: This study has validated a generative model utility metric, the multivariate Hellinger distance, which can be used to reliably rank competing SDG methods on the same data set. The Hellinger distance metric can be used to evaluate and compare alternate SDG methods.

AB  - Signature predictions for full-scale vehicles at Ka-band frequencies can require weeks or months of CPU time for completion; consequently, high performance computers are required in order for prediction codes to be useful in simulation support. Recent advances in Commodity-off-the-Shelf (COTS) personal computer (PC) hardware along with open-source operating systems such as Linux allow for a cost-effective solution to computational requirements routinely encountered in signature analysis and synthetic data generation in support of hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) simulation. This paper presents the development and evaluation of a Pile-of-PC (PoPC) cluster in support of full-scale, high-frequency signature predictions.

AB  - Graph neural networks (GNNs) are quickly becoming the standard approach for learning on graph structured data across several domains, but they lack transparency in their decision-making. Several perturbation-based approaches have been developed to provide insights into the decision making process of GNNs. As this is an early research area, the methods and data used to evaluate the generated explanations lack maturity. We explore these existing approaches and identify common pitfalls in three main areas: (1) synthetic data generation process, (2) evaluation metrics, and (3) the final presentation of the explanation. For this purpose, we perform an empirical study to explore these pitfalls along with their unintended consequences and propose remedies to mitigate their effects.

AB  - We propose an end-to-end approach for synthetic QA data generation. Our model comprises a single transformer-based encoderdecoder network that is trained end-to-end to generate both answers and questions. In a nutshell, we feed a passage to the encoder and ask the decoder to generate a question and an answer token-by-token. The likelihood produced in the generation process is used as a filtering score, which avoids the need for a separate filtering model. Our generator is trained by finetuning a pretrained LM using maximum likelihood estimation. The experimental results indicate significant improvements in the domain adaptation of QA models outperforming current state-of-the-art methods.

AB  - Electrocardiogram (ECG) synthesis is a challenging task due to the complex dynamic nature of ECG signals. In this paper, we present a novel approach for ECG synthesis based on Generative Adversarial Networks. We study how to incorporate prior knowledge on morphological ECG patterns into synthetic data generation. We demonstrate how to improve the modeling of the complex dynamics of ECG signals by separating between modeling temporal and amplitude variations. To evaluate our proposal, we consider ECG signals taken from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database for training our models. The obtained experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach for generating synthetic ECG signals and improving ECG classification.

AB  - Underwater robotic surveys can be costly due to the complex working environment and the need for various sensor modalities. While underwater simulators are essential, many existing simulators lack sufficient rendering quality, restricting their ability to transfer algorithms from simulation to real-world applications. To address this limitation, we introduce UNav-Sim, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first simulator to incorporate the efficient, high-detail rendering of Unreal Engine 5 (UE5). UNav-Sim is open-source(1) and includes an autonomous vision-based navigation stack. By supporting standard robotics tools like ROS, UNav-Sim enables researchers to develop and test algorithms for underwater environments efficiently.

AB  - Microsimulation models are widely used to evaluate the potential effects of different policies on social indicators. Most microsimulation models in use operate on a national level, disregarding regional variations. We describe the construction of a national microsimulation model for Germany, accounting for local variations in each of the more than 10,000 communities in Germany. The database used and the mechanisms implementing the population dynamics are described. Finally, the further development of the database and microsimulation programs are outlined, which will contribute towards a research lab that will be made available to the wider scientific community.

AB  - Nowadays, with the pervasiveness of social networks among the people, the possibility of publishing incorrect information has increased more than before. Therefore, detecting fake news and users who publish this incorrect information is of great importance. This paper has proposed a system based on combining context-user and context-network features with the help of a conditional generative adversarial network for balancing the data set to detect users who publish incorrect information in the Persian language on Twitter. Moreover, by conducting numerous experiments, the proposed system in terms of evaluation metrics compared to its competitors, has produced good performance results in detecting fake users.

AB  - The synthetic generation of data is appropriate in many cases. The data generated can be of different nature: program texts, tables, XML documents, etc. The application area of such data comprises not only the scientific research and analysis of the real program system features, but the teaching activity, too. The generation of texts of different problems, belonging to the same type, represents such a case. The problems could be used for self-preparation as after-class training, for solving exercises in class, or for assessing the students' knowledge in a given discipline. This paper discusses the philosophy and development of a system generated sets of synthetic program texts of the same type. The examples considered are for teaching purpose.

AB  - We present a Bayesian inference scheme for scaled Brownian motion, and investigate its performance on synthetic data for parameter estimation and model selection in a combined inference with fractional Brownian motion. We include the possibility of measurement noise in both models. We find that for trajectories of a few hundred time points the procedure is able to resolve well the true model and parameters. Using the prior of the synthetic data generation process also for the inference, the approach is optimal based on decision theory. We include a comparison with inference using a prior different from the data generating one.

Instead of using an existing dataset from the UCR archive as the source dataset, we generated a 15,000,000 synthetic univariate time series dataset that was created using our unique synthetic time series generator algorithm which can generate data with diverse patterns and angles and different sequence lengths. Furthermore, instead of using classification tasks provided by the UCR archive as the source task as previous studies did, we used our own 55 regression tasks as the source tasks, which produced better results than selecting classification tasks from the UCR archive.

TI  - Content Disentanglement for Semantically Consistent Synthetic-to-Real Domain Adaptation
T2  - 2021 IEEE/RSJ INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT ROBOTS AND SYSTEMS (IROS)

CP  - IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)
AB  - Synthetic data generation is an appealing approach to generate novel traffic scenarios in autonomous driving. However, deep learning perception algorithms trained solely on synthetic data encounter serious performance drops when they are tested on real data. Such performance drops are commonly attributed to the domain gap between real and synthetic data. Domain adaptation methods that have been applied to mitigate the aforementioned domain gap achieve visually appealing results, but usually introduce semantic inconsistencies into the translated samples. In this work, we propose a novel, unsupervised, end-to-end domain adaptation network architecture that enables semantically consistent sim2real image transfer. Our method performs content disentanglement by employing shared content encoder and fixed style code.

AB  - Gene expression levels of organisms are measured by DNA microarrays. Finding biclusters in gene expression matrices provides invaluable information about effects of disease at the genetic level. These biclusters could identify which genes are up-regulated/down-regulated under certain conditions. This paper investigates a methodology for evolutionary-based biclustering using the NSGA-II algorithm. It also presents an improvement to the recovery and relevance external validation metrics as well as a new method for synthetic data generation for biclustering. Results obtained demonstrate its effectiveness in discovering useful biclusters on varied synthetic data when applied with the average Spearman's rho measure as the fitness function.

AB  - Due to their scalability and potential to integrate into existing communication protocols, consensus-based trust algorithms are a promising approach for detecting data falsification attacks in connected vehicle networks. Despite this potential, the standardized data sets necessary to support the development of these algorithms are not readily available. This manuscript demonstrates progress towards addressing this limitation by developing a synthetic data generation framework which - 1) simulates the generation of peer-estimated basic safety messages (BSM) within a real data set of BSM broadcasts, and 2) simulates the presence of malicious nodes within the network by injecting anomalies into peer-estimated and self-reported BSM signals.

TI  - Generalizing Back-Translation in Neural Machine Translation
T2  - FOURTH CONFERENCE ON MACHINE TRANSLATION (WMT 2019), VOL 1: RESEARCH PAPERS
LA  - English
CP  - 4th Conference on Machine Translation (WMT)
AB  - Back-translation - data augmentation by translating target monolingual data - is a crucial component in modern neural machine translation (NMT). In this work, we reformulate back-translation in the scope of cross-entropy optimization of an NMT model, clarifying its underlying mathematical assumptions and approximations beyond its heuristic usage. Our formulation covers broader synthetic data generation schemes, including sampling from a target-to-source NMT model. With this formulation, we point out fundamental problems of the sampling-based approaches and propose to remedy them by (i) disabling label smoothing for the target-to-source model and (ii) sampling from a restricted search space. Our statements are investigated on the WMT 2018 German <-> English news translation task.

AB  - Using the survival Clayton copula, we propose a method for generating synthetic data on such firm-size variables as operating revenues and the number of employees. Synthetic data must satisfy two stylized facts on firm-size statistics. First, firm-size distributions have power-law tails. Second, there should be a Gibrat's law for the ratio of two different firm-size variables. With the survival Clayton copula, we introduce random variables whose marginal distributions are uniform on the interval from 0 to 1, and transform them to obey power-law distributions. The resulting variables satisfy the two stylized facts.

AB  - Mobility datasets are crucial for various applications. However, sharing this data raises privacy concerns due to the sensitive nature of geolocation information. Synthetic data generation has recently emerged as a promising solution to protect geo-privacy of trajectory data. Current approaches rely on having a large set of authentic trajectories collected from individual users to train generative networks. However, this assumption proves impractical in many real-world scenarios due to the sensitive personal information typically embedded within trajectories. Our approach leverages federated learning to generate privacy-preserving synthetic trajectories without the need for centralized data collection. Experimental results demonstrate that our distributed framework effectively produces synthetic trajectories with distributions comparable to baseline, offering a privacy-conscious alternative for geo-privacy protection in mobility datasets.

AB  - Normalizing flow models have risen as a popular solution to the problem of density estimation, enabling high-quality synthetic data generation as well as exact probability density evaluation. However, in contexts where individuals are directly associated with the training data, releasing such a model raises privacy concerns. In this work, we propose the use of normalizing flow models that provide explicit differential privacy guarantees as a novel approach to the problem of privacy-preserving density estimation. We evaluate the efficacy of our approach empirically using benchmark datasets, and we demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches. We additionally show how our algorithm can be applied to the task of differentially private anomaly detection.

Synthetic data generation techniques are used in practice for cases where long wind speed data are required. In this study, a new wind speed data generation scheme based upon wavelet transformation is introduced and compared to the existing wind speed generation methods namely normal and Weibull distributed independent random numbers, the first- and second-order autoregressive models, and the first-order Markov chain. Results propose the wavelet-based approach as a wind speed data generation scheme to alternate the existing methods. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, visual analysis of photoreceptor cones can be both difficult and time consuming. The use of image processing techniques to automatically count and analyse these photoreceptor cones would be beneficial. This paper proposes the use of multi-scale modelling and normalized cross- correlation to identify retinal cones in image data obtained from a modified commercially available confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope (CSLO). The paper also illustrates a process of synthetic data generation to create images similar to those obtained from the CSLO. Comparisons between synthetic and manually labelled images and the automated algorithm are also presented.

AB  - Modeling housing markets is a challenging and central research area since they are highly related to the economy. However, the limited available data prevents researchers from improving models. As an alternative, this study introduces Housing GANs, a data-driven modeling approach inspired by the recent success of generative adversarial networks (GANs). The Housing GANs include a generator and discriminator function utilizing Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty and mitigate original housing datasets, including continuous and discrete data. The generator function predicts the real data distribution and generates realistic housing data. The empirical analysis highlights that the Housing GANs successfully learns the distribution and generate realistic housing data in high fidelity.

In this work, we present an agent-based simulator combining machine learning models and statistical models for different types of events. The key contribution of our model is the definition of a feedback loop between the agents output and input, enabling the synthetic generation of rich datasets that maintain the learned relationships from the original data.

AB  - Depth estimation is an important challenge in the field of augmented reality. Supervised deep learning methods of depth estimation can be difficult to use in novel settings due to the need for labeled training data. The work presented in this paper overcomes the challenge in a laparoscopic surgical simulation environment by using synthetic data generation for RGB-D training data. We also provide a neural network architecture that can generate real-time 448x448 depth map outputs suitable for use in AR applications. Our approach shows satisfactory performance when tested on a non-synthetic test dataset with an RMSE of 2.50 cm, MAE of 1.04 cm, and delta < 1.25 of 0.987.

AB  - Detection of underwater manmade objects via deep learning solutions is subject to unique challenges particular to sonar imaging, such as sparse target examples on the seafloor, distortions from sonar image construction, and variations of target pose and sediment accumulation. The combined effect of these artifacts in underwater imagery reduces the efficacy of convolutional neural networks, which achieve state-of-the-art performance on photometric imagery. To mitigate these issues, we implement synthetic data generation via factorization of StyleGAN2 and distortion augmentation, and evaluate several object detection architectures. We develop a detection framework to integrate these treatments and present results on a synthetic aperture sonar imagery dataset collected by an uncrewed undersea vehicle.

AB  - Bin picking is a core problem in industrial environments and robotics, with its main module as 6D pose estimation. However, industrial depth sensors have a lack of accuracy when it comes to small objects. Therefore, we propose a framework for pose estimation in highly cluttered scenes with small objects, which mainly relies on RGB data and makes use of depth information only for pose refinement. In this work, we compare synthetic data generation approaches for object detection and pose estimation and introduce a pose filtering algorithm that determines the most accurate estimated poses. We will make our real dataset for object detection available with the paper.

AB  - Generating synthetic data is a well-known option to limit disclosure risk in sensitive data releases. The usual approach is to build a model for the population and then generate a synthetic data set solely based on the model. We argue that building an accurate population model is difficult and we propose instead to approximate the original data as closely as privacy constraints permit. To enforce an ex ante privacy level when generating synthetic data, we introduce a new privacy model called epsilon-synthetic privacy. Then, we describe a synthetic data generation method that satisfies epsilon-synthetic privacy. Finally, we evaluate the utility of the synthetic data generated with our method.

AB  - The concept of Internet of Things (IoT) is rapidly moving from a vision to being pervasive in our everyday lives. This can be observed in the integration of connected sensors from a multitude of devices such as mobile phones, healthcare equipment, and vehicles. There is a need for the development of infrastructure support and analytical tools to handle IoT data, which are naturally big and complex. But, research on IoT data can be constrained by concerns about the release of privately owned data. In this paper, we present the design and implementation results of a synthetic IoT data generation framework. The framework enables research on synthetic data that exhibit the complex characteristics of original data without compromising proprietary information and personal privacy.

AB  - When taking advantage of technology, healthcare is often met with considerably more barriers to entry than business. Cloud platforms can offer great benefits such as scalability, reduced cost and the ability to effortlessly collaborate across services, and indeed, across the world [6] yet healthcare has been slow to take advantage of these gains. This paper explores the challenges faced by healthcare, how using synthetic data can avoid the initial information governance barriers, provide the experience to effectively evaluate cloud platforms, enable effective research collaboration with education and industry, and support the digital transformation journey.

TI  - Synthetic data as an enabler for machine learning applications in medicine
T2  - ISCIENCE
LA  - English
AB  - Synthetic data generation is the process of using machine learning methods to train a model that captures the patterns in a real dataset. Then new or synthetic data can be generated from that trained model. The synthetic data does not have a one-to-one mapping to the original data or to real patients, and therefore has the potential of privacy preserving properties. There is a growing interest in the application of synthetic data across health and life sciences, but to fully realize the benefits, further education, research, and policy innovation is required. This article summarizes the opportunities and challenges of SDG for health data, and provides directions for how this technology can be leveraged to accelerate data access for secondary purposes.

AB  - Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) has already made a big splash in the field of generating realistic "fake" data. However, when data is distributed and data-holders are reluctant to share data for privacy reasons, GAN's training is difficult. To address this issue, we propose private FL-GAN, a differential privacy generative adversarial network model based on federated learning. By strategically combining the Lipschitz limit with the differential privacy sensitivity, the model can generate high-quality synthetic data without sacrificing the privacy of the training data. We theoretically prove that private FL-GAN can provide strict privacy guarantee with differential privacy, and experimentally demonstrate our model can generate satisfactory data.

AB  - Contemporary building techniques and underlying theories of periodic autoregressive (PAR) models are revisited, reviewed, modified and recast. New techniques for generating synthetic data from any PAR model with provision to constrain some parameter values to zero have been proposed. The developed method is applied to the Ganges river for its monthly flow forecasting and generation. The results demonstrate that the PAR model can capture the seasonal variability of the Ganges river flow reasonably well preserving both its short- and the long-term important historical statistics.

AB  - We propose AIM, a new algorithm for differentially private synthetic data generation. AIM is aworkload-adaptive algorithm within the paradigm of algorithms that first selects a set of queries, then privately measures those queries, and finally generates synthetic data from the noisy measurements. It uses a set of innovative features to iteratively select the most useful measurements, reflecting both their relevance to the workload and their value in approximating the input data. We also provide analytic expressions to bound per-query error with high probability which can be used to construct confidence intervals and inform users about the accuracy of generated data. We show empirically that AIM consistently outperforms a wide variety of existing mechanisms across a variety of experimental settings.

AB  - Automatic detection of animals that have strayed into human inhabited areas has important security and road safety applications. This paper attempts to solve this problem using deep learning techniques from a variety of computer vision fields including object detection, segmentation, tracking and edge detection. Several interesting insights into transfer learning are elicited while adapting models trained on benchmark datasets for real world deployment. Empirical evidence is presented to demonstrate the inability of detectors to generalize from training images of animals in their natural habitats to deployment scenarios of man-made environments. A solution is also proposed using semi-automated synthetic data generation for domain specific training. Code and data used in the experiments are made available to facilitate further work in this domain.

AB  - It is well known to generate synthetic data sets by the sequential regression multiple imputation (SRMI) method. The R-package synthpop are widely used for generating synthetic data by the SRMI approaches. In this paper, I suggest generating synthetic data based on the probabilistic principal component analysis (PPCA) method. Two simple data sets are used for a simulation study to compare the SRMI and PPCA approaches. Simulation results demonstrate that pairwise coe fficients in synthetic data sets by PPCA can be closer to original ones than by SRMI. Furthermore, for the various data types that PPCA applications are well established, such as time series data, the PPCA approach can be extended to generate synthetic data sets.

KW  - BLIND SEPARATION
AB  - The reflections caused by common semi-reflectors, such as glass windows, can impact the performance of computer vision algorithms. State-of-the-art methods can remove reflections on synthetic data and in controlled scenarios. However, they are based on strong assumptions and do not generalize well to real-world images. Contrary to a common misconception, real-world images are challenging even when polarization information is used. We present a deep learning approach to separate the reflected and the transmitted components of the recorded irradiance, which explicitly uses the polarization properties of light. To train it, we introduce an accurate synthetic data generation pipeline, which simulates realistic reflections, including those generated by curved and non-ideal surfaces, non-static scenes, and high-dynamic-range scenes.

AB  - Although highly valuable for a variety of applications, urban mobility data are rarely made openly available, as it contains sensitive personal information. Synthetic data aims to solve this issue by generating artificial data that resembles an original dataset in structural and statistical characteristics, but omits sensitive information. For mobility data, a large number of corresponding models have been proposed in the past decade. This systematic review provides a structured comparative overview of the current state of this heterogeneous, active field of research. A special focus is put on the applicability of the reviewed models in practice.

AB  - In terms of electric vehicles (EVs), electric kickboards are crucial elements of smart transportation networks for short-distance travel that is risk-free, economical, and environmentally friendly. Forecasting the daily demand can improve the local service provider's access to information and help them manage their short-term supply more effectively. This study developed the forecasting model using real-time data and weather information from Jeju Island, South Korea. Cluster analysis under the rental pattern of the electric kickboard is a component of the forecasting processes. We cannot achieve noticeable results at first because of the low amount of training data. We require a lot of data to produce a solid prediction result. For the sake of the subsequent experimental procedure, we created synthetic time-series data using a generative adversarial networks (GAN) approach and combined the synthetic data with the original data. The outcomes have shown how the GAN-based synthetic data generation approach has the potential to enhance prediction accuracy. We employ an ensemble model to improve prediction results that cannot be achieved using a single regressor model. It is a weighted combination of several base regression models to one meta-regressor. To anticipate the daily demand in this study, we create an ensemble model by merging three separate base machine learning algorithms, namely CatBoost, Random Forest (RF), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). The effectiveness of the suggested strategies was assessed using some evaluation indicators. The forecasting outcomes demonstrate that mixing synthetic data with original data improves the robustness of daily demand forecasting and outperforms other models by generating more agreeable values for suggested assessment measures. The outcomes further show that applying ensemble techniques can reasonably increase the forecasting model's accuracy for daily electric kickboard demand.

AB  - Data is increasingly collected on practically every area of human life, e.g. from health care to financial or work aspects, and from many different sources. As the amount of data gathered grows, efforts to leverage it have intensified. Many organizations are interested to analyse or share the data they collect, as it may be used to provide critical services and support much-needed research. However, this often conflicts with data protection regulations. Thus sharing, analyzing and working with those sensitive data while preserving the privacy of the individuals represented by the data is needed. Synthetic data generation is one method increasingly used for achieving this goal. Using synthetic data would useful also for anomaly detection tasks, which often contains highly sensitive data.
   While synthetic data generation aims at capturing the most relevant statistical properties of a dataset to create a dataset with similar characteristics, it is less explored if this method is capable of capturing also the properties of anomalous data, which is generally a minority class with potentially very few samples, and can thus reproduce meaningful anomaly instances. In this paper, we perform an extensive study on several anomaly detection techniques (supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised) on credit card fraud and medical (annthyroid) data, and evaluate the utility of corresponding, synthetically generated datasets, obtained by various different synthetisation methods. Moreover, for supervised methods, we have also investigated various sampling methods; sampling in average improves the results, and we show that this transfers also to detectors learned on synthetic data. Overall, our evaluation shows that models trained on synthetic data can achieve a performance that renders them a viable alternative to real data, sometimes even outperforming them. Based on the evaluation, we provide guidelines on which synthesizer method to use for which anomaly detection setting.

AB  - Differentially private (DP) synthetic datasets are a solution for sharing data while preserving the privacy of individual data providers. Understanding the effects of utilizing DP synthetic data in end-to-end machine learning pipelines impacts areas such as health care and humanitarian action, where data is scarce and regulated by restrictive privacy laws. In this work, we investigate the extent to which synthetic data can replace real, tabular data in machine learning pipelines and identify the most effective synthetic data generation techniques for training and evaluating machine learning models. We systematically investigate the impacts of differentially private synthetic data on downstream classification tasks from the point of view of utility as well as fairness. Our analysis is comprehensive and includes representatives of the two main types of synthetic data generation algorithms: marginal-based and GAN-based. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first that: (i) proposes a training and evaluation framework that does not assume that real data is available for testing the utility and fairness of machine learning models trained on synthetic data; (ii) presents the most extensive analysis of synthetic dataset generation algorithms in terms of utility and fairness when used for training machine learning models; and (iii) encompasses several different definitions of fairness. Our findings demonstrate that marginal-based synthetic data generators surpass GAN-based ones regarding model training utility for tabular data. Indeed, we show that models trained using data generated by marginal-based algorithms can exhibit similar utility to models trained using real data. Our analysis also reveals that the marginal-based synthetic data generated using AIM and MWEM PGM algorithms can train models that simultaneously achieve utility and fairness characteristics close to those obtained by models trained with real data.

AB  - Deriving blood pressure in a non-invasive way via photoplethysmography (PPG) signals has become a familiar topic. With the knowledge of the relation between PPG and blood pressure, we expect to further make the measurement contactless for convenience reasons. An alternative signal source is remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) signals. There are mainly two kinds of approaches for exploiting blood pressure through PPG signals, one is by calculating the pulse transit time of the arterial pulse wave at two consecutive sites and the other is based on waveform feature analysis from a single signal. The calibration procedure is necessary for the former way, which leads to some limitations in general use. On the other hand, the properties of the rPPG waveform are far from PPG signals. Hence, the known waveform features in PPG signals are hard to be leveraged in the case of rPPG signals. Recently, convolutional neural networks are also applied for solving this problem. However, the lack of data is an obstacle to the training procedure and evaluation. In this study, a multichannel rPPG-based blood pressure estimator is proposed. To ease the data scarcity issue, the generative adversarial network is adopted to augment synthetic waveform data. Besides, as we know that some physiological states like age and BMI are dominant factors in blood pressure. InfoGAN is chosen in this work to generate the synthetic data with the blood pressure value fluctuating correspondingly to the controlled age and BMI combination. The proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on MIMIC III and Cuffless datasets. With the synthetic data generation, the mean absolute error (MAE) is reduced to 6.72 and 5.95 mmHg in MAP and DBP respectively. The standard deviations of the MAEs are also reduced. In the rPPG case, the MAE of SBP is 9.13 and 8.76 mmHg for DBP.

AB  - Industrial control systems (ICSs) are integral to managing and optimizing processes in various industries, including manufacturing, power generation, and more. However, the scarcity of widely adopted ICS datasets hampers research efforts in areas like optimization and security. This scarcity arises due to the substantial cost and technical expertise required to create physical ICS environments. In response to these challenges, this paper presents a groundbreaking approach to generating synthetic ICS data through a data-driven ICS network simulation. We circumvent the need for expensive hardware by recreating the entire ICS environment in software. Moreover, rather than manually replicating the control logic of ICS components, we leverage existing data to autonomously generate control logic. The core of our method involves the stochastic setting of setpoints, which introduces randomness into the generated data. Setpoints serve as target values for controlling the operation of the ICS process. This approach enables us to augment existing ICS datasets and cater to the data requirements of machine learning-based ICS intrusion detection systems and other data-driven applications. Our simulated ICS environment employs virtualized containers to mimic the behavior of real-world PLCs and SCADA systems, while control logic is deduced from publicly available ICS datasets. Setpoints are generated probabilistically to ensure data diversity. Experimental results validate the fidelity of our synthetic data, emphasizing their ability to closely replicate temporal and statistical characteristics of real-world ICS networks. In conclusion, this innovative data-driven ICS network simulation offers a cost-effective and scalable solution for generating synthetic ICS data. It empowers researchers in the field of ICS optimization and security with diverse, realistic datasets, furthering advancements in this critical domain. Future work may involve refining the simulation model and exploring additional applications for synthetic ICS data.

AB  - Industries are going through the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0), where technologies like the Industrial Internet of things, big data analytics, and machine learning (ML) are extensively utilized to improve the productivity and efficiency of manufacturing systems and processes. This work aims to further investigate the applicability and improve the effectiveness of ML prediction models for fault diagnosis in the smart manufacturing process. Hence, we propose several methodologies and ML models for fault diagnosis for smart manufacturing process applications. A case study has been conducted on a real dataset from a semiconductor manufacturing (SECOM) process. However, this dataset contains missing values, noisy features, and class imbalance problem. This imbalance problem makes it so difficult to accurately predict the minority class, due to the majority class size difference. In the literature, efforts have been made to alleviate the class imbalance problem using several synthetic data generation techniques (SDGT) on the UCI machine learning repository SECOM dataset. In this work, to handle the imbalance problem, we employed, compared, and evaluated the feasibility of three SDGT on this dataset. To handle issues related to the missing values and noisy features, we implemented two missing values imputation techniques and feature selection techniques, respectively. We then developed and compared the performance of ten predictive ML models against these proposed methodologies. The results obtained across several evaluation metrics of performance were significant. A comparative analysis shows the feasibility and validate the effectiveness of these SDGT and the proposed methodologies. Some among the proposed methodologies could produce an accuracy in the range of 99.5% to 100%. Furthermore, based on a comparative analysis with similar models from the literature, our proposed models outpaced those proposed in the literature.

AB  - The human brain has the ability to carry out new tasks with limited experience. It utilizes prior learning experiences to adapt the solution strategy to new domains. On the other hand, deep neural networks (DNNs) generally need large amounts of data and computational resources for training. However, this requirement is not met in many settings. To address these challenges, we propose the TUTOR (training neural networks using decision rules as model priors) DNN synthesis framework. TUTOR targets tabular datasets. It synthesizes accurate DNN models with limited available data and reduced memory/computational requirements. It consists of three sequential steps. The first step involves generation, verification, and labeling of synthetic data. The synthetic data generation module targets both categorical and continuous features. TUTOR generates synthetic data from the same probability distribution as the real data. It then verifies the integrity of the generated synthetic data using a semantic integrity classifier module. It labels synthetic data based on a set of rules extracted from the real dataset. Next, TUTOR uses two training schemes that combine synthetic and training data to learn the DNN model parameters. These two schemes focus on two different ways in which synthetic data can be used to derive a prior on the model parameters and, hence, provide a better DNN initialization for training with real data. In the third step, TUTOR employs a grow-and-prune synthesis paradigm to learn both the weights and the architecture of the DNN to reduce model size while ensuring its accuracy. We evaluate the performance of TUTOR on nine datasets of various sizes. We show that in comparison to fully connected DNNs, TUTOR, on an average, reduces the need for data by 5.9x (geometric mean), improves accuracy by 3.4%, and reduces the number of parameters (floating-point operations) by 4.7 x (4.3 x) (geometric mean). Thus, TUTOR enables less data-hungry, more accurate, and more compact DNN synthesis.

KW  - ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE
AB  - Analyzing medical data to find abnormalities is a time-consuming and costly task, particularly for rare abnormalities, requiring tremendous efforts from medical experts. Therefore, artificial intelligence has become a popular tool for the automatic processing of medical data, acting as a supportive tool for doctors. However, the machine learning models used to build these tools are highly dependent on the data used to train them. Large amounts of data can be difficult to obtain in medicine due to privacy reasons, expensive and time-consuming annotations, and a general lack of data samples for infrequent lesions. In this study, we present a novel synthetic data generation pipeline, called SinGAN-Seg, to produce synthetic medical images with corresponding masks using a single training image. Our method is different from the traditional generative adversarial networks (GANs) because our model needs only a single image and the corresponding ground truth to train. We also show that the synthetic data generation pipeline can be used to produce alternative artificial segmentation datasets with corresponding ground truth masks when real datasets are not allowed to share. The pipeline is evaluated using qualitative and quantitative comparisons between real data and synthetic data to show that the style transfer technique used in our pipeline significantly improves the quality of the generated data and our method is better than other state-of-the-art GANs to prepare synthetic images when the size of training datasets are limited. By training UNet++ using both real data and the synthetic data generated from the SinGAN-Seg pipeline, we show that the models trained on synthetic data have very close performances to those trained on real data when both datasets have a considerable amount of training data. In contrast, we show that synthetic data generated from the SinGAN-Seg pipeline improves the performance of segmentation models when training datasets do not have a considerable amount of data. All experiments were performed using an open dataset and the code is publicly available on GitHub.

AB  - Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) has become one of the major tools of likelihood-free statistical inference in complex mathematical models. Simultaneously, stochastic differential equations (SDEs) have developed to an established tool for modelling time-dependent, real-world phenomena with underlying random effects. When applying ABC to stochastic models, two major difficulties arise: First, the derivation of effective summary statistics and proper distances is particularly challenging, since simulations from the stochastic process under the same parameter configuration result in different trajectories. Second, exact simulation schemes to generate trajectories from the stochastic model are rarely available, requiring the derivation of suitable numerical methods for the synthetic data generation. To obtain summaries that are less sensitive to the intrinsic stochasticity of the model, we propose to build up the statistical method (e.g. the choice of the summary statistics) on the underlying structural properties of the model. Here, we focus on the existence of an invariant measure and we map the data to their estimated invariant density and invariant spectral density. Then, to ensure that these model properties are kept in the synthetic data generation, we adopt measure-preserving numerical splitting schemes. The derived property-based and measure-preserving ABC method is illustrated on the broad class of partially observed Hamiltonian type SDEs, both with simulated data and with real electroencephalography data. The derived summaries are particularly robust to the model simulation, and this fact, combined with the proposed reliable numerical scheme, yields accurate ABC inference. In contrast, the inference returned using standard numerical methods (Euler-Maruyama discretisation) fails. The proposed ingredients can be incorporated into any type of ABC algorithm and directly applied to all SDEs that are characterised by an invariant distribution and for which a measure-preserving numerical method can be derived.

AB  - Synthetic data generation via generative modeling has recently become a prominent research field in genomics, with applications ranging from functional sequence design to high-quality, privacy-preserving artificial in silico genomes. Following a body of work on Artificial Genomes (AGs) created via various generative models trained with raw genomic input, we propose a conceptually different approach to address the issues of scalability and complexity of genomic data generation in very high dimensions. Our method combines dimensionality reduction, achieved by Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) learning in this reduced space. We compare the quality of AGs generated by our approach with AGs generated by the established models and report improvements on capturing population structure and linkage disequilibrium.

AB  - Recent Metal Artifacts Reduction (MAR) methods for Computed Tomography are often based on image-to-image convolutional neural networks for adjustment of corrupted sinograms or images themselves. In this paper, we are exploring the capabilities of a multidomain method, which consists of both sinogram correction (projection domain step) and restored image correction (image-domain step). We formulate the first step problem directly as sinogram inpainting, which allows us to use methods of this specific field, such as partial convolutions. Moreover, we propose a synthetic data generation pipeline to avoid problems with overfitting to metal shapes set and an artifacts formation technique. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (-75% MSE) improvement in comparison with a classic benchmark - Li-MAR.

AB  - Background Synthetic data have been proposed as a solution for sharing anonymized versions of sensitive biomedical datasets. Ideally, synthetic data should preserve the structure and statistical properties of the original data, while protecting the privacy of the individual subjects. Differential Privacy (DP) is currently considered the gold standard approach for balancing this trade-off. Objectives The aim of this study is to investigate how trustworthy are group differences discovered by independent sample tests from DP-synthetic data. The evaluation is carried out in terms of the tests' Type I and Type II errors. With the former, we can quantify the tests' validity, i.e., whether the probability of false discoveries is indeed below the significance level, and the latter indicates the tests' power in making real discoveries. Methods We evaluate the Mann-Whitney U test, Student's t-test, chi-squared test, and median test on DP-synthetic data. The private synthetic datasets are generated from real-world data, including a prostate cancer dataset (n = 500) and a cardiovascular dataset (n = 70,000), as well as on bivariate and multivariate simulated data. Five different DP-synthetic data generation methods are evaluated, including two basic DP histogram release methods and MWEM, Private-PGM, and DP GAN algorithms. Conclusion A large portion of the evaluation results expressed dramatically inflated Type I errors, especially at levels of & varepsilon; <= 1. This result calls for caution when releasing and analyzing DP-synthetic data: low p-values may be obtained in statistical tests simply as a byproduct of the noise added to protect privacy. A DP Smoothed Histogram-based synthetic data generation method was shown to produce valid Type I error for all privacy levels tested but required a large original dataset size and a modest privacy budget (& varepsilon; >= 5) in order to have reasonable Type II error levels.

AB  - Autoregressive and Masked Transformers are incredibly effective as generative models and classifiers. While these models are most prevalent in NLP, they also exhibit strong performance in other domains, such as vision. This work contributes to the exploration of transformer-based models in synthetic data generation for diverse application domains. In this paper, we present TabMT, a novel Masked Transformer design for generating synthetic tabular data. TabMT effectively addresses the unique challenges posed by heterogeneous data fields and is natively able to handle missing data. Our design leverages improved masking techniques to allow for generation and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance from extremely small to extremely large tabular datasets. We evaluate TabMT for privacy-focused applications and find that it is able to generate high quality data with superior privacy tradeoffs.

AB  - Recent studies have proposed computational models for a functional brain-heart interplay (BHI) assessment based on electroencephalography (EEG). Nevertheless, the role of the EEG electrical reference on such BHI estimates has not been investigated yet. Here we present a pilot study assessing BHI in 4 minutes resting-state in 10 healthy subjects through methods including heartbeat-evoked potentials (HEP) and oscillations, Maximal Information Coefficient, and our recently proposed model based on Synthetic Data Generation (SDG). EEG signals were re-referenced to the Cz channel, common average, mastoids, and Laplacian. Results for EEG power in the a band indicate that the most significant differences between BHI methods are with the Laplacian reference while a higher agreement exists between HEP and SDG approaches.

The trend to use machine learning to estimate the 6D pose of objects is driven by higher robustness and faster processing times. Machine-learning based 6D pose estimation algorithms are available with varying estimation performance, robustness and flexibility. Suitable algorithms have to be selected based on use-case specific production requirements. A concept to evaluate these algorithms is presented. The generation of synthetic data based on the production requirements is proposed, followed by an evaluation of the algorithms to assess the generalization performance from generic benchmark datasets to custom industrial datasets. The overall pipeline is presented, realized and discussed.

This work proposes a random-search based approach to instantiate statistical indicators through an improved mobility scenario which provides specific information about people attending one or several days for some events. Then, we recreate that scenario with virtual humans, proposing a synthetic and open dataset that matches the original statistical data. The results show the proposed approach is very efficient to model people's mobility, and the generated data has a low error rate compared to the original one.

AB  - The capabilities of object detection are well known, but many projects don't use them, despite potential benefit. Even though the use of object detection algorithms is facilitated through frameworks and publications, a big issue is the creation of the necessary training data. To tackle this issue, this work shows the design and evaluation of a prototype, which allows users to create synthetic datasets for object detection in images. The prototype is evaluated using YOLOv3 as the underlying detector and shows that the generated datasets are equally good in quality as manually created data. This encourages a wide adoption of object detection algorithms in different areas, since image creation and labeling is often the most time consuming step.

Firstly, data from a simulation model was used to identify the essential vehicle dynamics variables needed and to create the network structure. Then this network was retrained to classify real-world vehicle skidding events. The final network consists of a 3 layer network with 10, 5 and 1 output neurons 13 inputs, 4 outputs and a 5 step time delay. The retrained network was used on a limited set of real vehicle data and confirmed the effectiveness of the network classifying lateral skidding events.

We then describe how these weaknesses make existing designs unsuitable for the requirements needed for a consortium of health registries work-ing towards generating synthetic data sets for research purposes. Moreover, we propose how these weaknesses can be addressed with our novel architecture solution. Our architecture solution combines several building blocks to generate synthetic data in a decentralised setting. Federated GANs, Consortium blockchains, and Shamir Se-cret Sharing algorithm are the core building blocks of our proposed architecture solution. Finally, we discuss our proposed solution's advantages, disadvantages and future research directions.

AB  - Releasing and sharing mobility data, and specifically trajectories, is necessary for many applications, from infrastructure planning to epidemiology. Yet, trajectories are highly sensitive data, because the points visited by an individual can be identifying and also confidential. Hence, trajectories must be anonymized before releasing or sharing them. While most contributions to the trajectory anonymization literature take statistical approaches, deep learning is increasingly being used. We observe that natural language sentences and trajectories share a sequential nature that can be exploited in similar ways. In this paper, we present preliminary work on generating synthetic trajectories using machine learning models typically used for natural language processing. Our empirical results attest to the quality of the generated synthetic trajectories. Furthermore, our methods allow discovering natural neighborhoods based on trajectories.

AB  - This paper presents a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) baseline algorithm that uses a quantized grayscale matching (QGM) algorithm.(10) QGM is a classifier that uses a template matching approach to identify the target, has been throughly tested as part of the MSTAR program,(10) and has shown to be robust to fluctuation in the absolute amplitude. A performance study is conducted to show how translation and obscuration/shadowing affects the performance of the QGM algorithm for SAR synthetic data at multiple different resolutions. This QGM implementation along with the synthetic data generation capability allows researchers to test the susceptibility of QGM to different operating conditions and, in addition, provides a baseline algorithm for comparison.

AB  - Despite significant progress in global localization of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in GPS-denied environments, existing methods remain constrained by the availability of datasets. Current datasets often focus on small-scale scenes and lack viewpoint variability, accurate ground truth (GT) pose, and UAV build-in sensor data. To address these limitations, we introduce a large-scale 6-DoF UAV dataset for localization (UAVD4L) and develop a two-stage 6-DoF localization pipeline (UAVLoc), which consists of offline synthetic data generation and online visual localization. Additionally, based on the 6-DoF estimator, we design a hierarchical system for tracking ground target in 3D space. Experimental results on the new dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/RingoWRW/UAVD4L.

AB  - In power system applications, accessing real data is one of the main challenges. Load modeling is an example that can be hampered by a lack of real data. This paper proposes synthetic data generation as a solution to deal with insufficient datasets. To this end, Timeseries Generative Adversarial Networks (TimeGANs) are proposed to create synthetic electricity data for an agricultural load. Center pivot irrigation system data is targeted, which does not exhibit the same trends as residential or commercial utility data, and information is presented in the lower dimensions. Obtained results show that TimeGANs can leverage the lower dimensional information to produce synthetic data with the same characteristics as the actual data. The proposed method can be utilized for modeling different electric loads.

AB  - Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently emerged as popular methods for learning representations of non-euclidean data often encountered in diverse areas ranging from chemistry to source code generation. Recently, researchers have focused on learning about temporal graphs, wherein the nodes and edges of a graph and their respective features may change over time. In this paper, we focus on a nascent domain: learning generative models on temporal graphs. We have noticed that papers on this topic so far have lacked a standard evaluation for all existing models on the same benchmark of datasets and a solid evaluation protocol. We present extensive comparative experiments on state-of-the-art models from the literature. Furthermore, we propose a rigorous evaluation protocol to assess temporal generation quality, utility, and privacy.

AB  - The paper presents a methodology for training neural networks for vision tasks on synthesized data on the example of steel defect recognition in automated production control systems. The article describes the process of dataset procedural generation of steel slab defects with a symmetrical distribution. The results of training two neural networks Unet and Xception on a generated data grid and testing them on real data are presented. The performance of these neural networks was assessed using real data from the Severstal: Steel Defect Detection set. In both cases, the neural networks showed good results in the classification and segmentation of surface defects of steel workpieces in the image. Dice score on synthetic data reaches 0.62, and accuracy-0.81.

CP  - 57th Annual Meeting of the Association-for-Computational-Linguistics (ACL)
AB  - We introduce a novel method of generating synthetic question answering corpora by combining models of question generation and answer extraction, and by filtering the results to ensure roundtrip consistency. By pretraining on the resulting corpora we obtain significant improvements on SQuAD2 (Rajpurkar et al., 2018) and NQ (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019), establishing a new state-of-the-art on the latter. Our synthetic data generation models, for both question generation and answer extraction, can be fully reproduced by finetuning a publicly available BERT model (Devlin et al., 2018) on the extractive subsets of SQuAD2 and NQ. We also describe a more powerful variant that does full sequence-to-sequence pretraining for question generation, obtaining exact match and F1 at less than 0.1% and 0.4% from human performance on SQuAD2.

AB  - In this paper, we present a new methodology to generate synthetic data for training a deep neural network (DNN) to estimate depth maps directly from stereo images of underwater scenes. The proposed method projects real underwater images onto landscapes of randomized heights in a 3D rendering framework. This procedure provides a synthetic stereo image pair and the corresponding depth map of the scene, which are used to train a disparity estimation DNN. Through this process, we learn to match the underwater feature space using supervised learning without the need to capture extensive real underwater depth maps for ground truth. In our results, we demonstrate improved accuracy of reconstruction compared to traditional computer vision feature matching methods and state-of-the-art DNNs trained on synthetic terrestrial data.

AB  - In this paper, we focus on the problem of preserving the data confidentiality when sharing the data for clustering. This problem poses new challenges for novel uses of privacy preserving data mining (PPDM) techniques. Specifically, this paper considers the synthetic data generation as a way to preserve the data privacy.
   One of the state of the art synthetic data generators is the IPSO family of methods. It has been stated that the use of IPSO to generate synthetic data is appropriate when the user plans to apply clustering to the data. Moreover, this paper aims to associate the same property to the FCRM synthetic data generator, and at the same time, to assess the relationship between the information loss produced when generating synthetic data with FCRM and the clustering similarity between the original and synthetic data.

AB  - In this work, we propose a method for automatic emotion recognition from movie clips. This problem has applications in indexing and retrieval of large movie and video collections, summarization of visual content, selection of emotion-invoking materials, and such. Our approach aims to estimate valence and arousal values automatically. We extract audio and visual features, summarize them via functionals, PCA, and Fisher vector encoding approaches. We used feature selection based on canonical correlation analysis. For classification, we used extreme learning machine and support vector machine. We tested our approach on the LIRIS-ACCEDE database with ground truth annotations. The class imbalance problem was solved by generating synthetic data. By fusing the best features at score and feature level, we obtain good results on this problem, especially for the valence prediction.

AB  - Creating and labeling data can be extremely time consuming and labor intensive. For this reason, lack of sufficiently large datasets for training deep structures is often noted as a major obstacle and instead, synthetic data generation is proposed. With their high acquisition and labeling complexity, this also applies to fingerprints. In the literature, a number of synthetic fingerprint generation systems have been proposed, but mostly for algorithm evaluation purposes. In this paper, we aim to analyze the use of synthetic fingerprint data with different levels of degradation for training deep neural networks. Fingerprint classification problem is selected as a case-study and the experiments are conducted on a public domain database, NIST SD4. A positive correlation between the synthetic data variation and the classification rate is observed while achieving state-of-the-art results.

AB  - Removing reflections from a single RGB image is a highly ill-posed problem. Unlike RGB images, near-infrared (NIR) images obtained through an active NIR camera are less likely to be affected by reflections when glass and camera planes form certain angles, while textures on objects could "vanish" under certain circumstances. Based on this observation, we propose a two-stream neural network to remove undesired reflections in an RGB image with the guidance of an NIR image. To tackle the insufficiency of training data, we propose a synthetic data generation pipeline that simulates the reflection-suppressing nature of the active NIR imaging and build a dataset mixed with synthetic and real data. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art reflection removal methods in both quantitative metrics and visual quality.

AB  - Use of synthetic data is rapidly emerging as a realistic alternative to manually annotating real data for industry-scale model building. Manual data annotation is slow, expensive and not preferred for meeting customer privacy expectations. Further, commercial natural language applications are required to support continuously evolving features as well as newly added experiences. To address these requirements, we propose a targeted synthetic data generation technique by inserting tokens into a given semantic signature. The generated data are used as additional training samples in the tasks of intent classification and named entity recognition. We evaluate on a real-world voice assistant dataset, and using only 33% of the available training set, we achieve the same accuracy as training with all available data. Further, we analyze the effects of data generation across varied real-world applications and propose heuristics that improve the task performance further.

AB  - Autonomous driving heavily relies on accurate lateral control to ensure safe and reliable operation. In this paper, we present a novel approach to exploit the potential of digital twins for steering angle prediction in autonomous driving. Our method combines the use of a custom-built tool, SteeraTool, for generating a high -fidelity dataset, SteeraSet, of steering angle data with the implementation of a simple deep neural network architecture. The dataset was collected through simulations in a diverse range of scenarios. The neural network model was trained and evaluated on the generated dataset, and achieved promising results. Our work lays the groundwork to leverage the potential of digital twins in the area of lateral control. Moreover, SteeraTool can be used as a testbed in this area.

AB  - Clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning and data mining problem defined as a process of assigning objects to groups so that objects in the same group are similar to each other and differ from objects in other groups. In this paper, a data clustering method is proposed that is based on unsupervised training of a generative neural network using the technique of Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation (IMLE). Given a dataset, IMLE is an unsupervised method that trains a neural network that takes random noise as input and produces synthetic data samples whose distribution is close to the original data. We have developed an appropriate adaptation of the IMLE generative approach that also achieves clustering of the dataset. The proposed clustering method has been evaluated on several popular datasets of various types and complexity yielding promising results.

AB  - Biomedical research often involves studying patient data that contain personal information. Inappropriate use of these data might lead to leakage of sensitive information, which can put patient privacy at risk. The problem of preserving patient privacy has received increasing attentions in the era of big data. Many privacy methods have been developed to protect against various attack models. This paper reviews relevant topics in the context of biomedical research. We discuss privacy preserving technologies related to (1) record linkage, (2) synthetic data generation, and (3) genomic data privacy. We also discuss the ethical implications of big data privacy in biomedicine and present challenges in future research directions for improving data privacy in biomedical research.

T2  - 2023 IEEE INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON BIOMETRICS, IJCB

CP  - IEEE International Joint Conference on Biometrics (IJCB)
AB  - Diffusion models are becoming increasingly popular in synthetic data generation and image editing applications. However, these models can amplify existing biases and propagate them to downstream applications. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the sources of bias in their outputs. In this paper, we investigate the presence of bias in diffusion-based face generation models with respect to attributes such as gender, race, and age. Moreover, we examine how dataset size affects the attribute composition and perceptual quality of both diffusion and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based face generation models across various attribute classes. Our findings suggest that diffusion models tend to worsen distribution bias in the training data for various attributes, which is heavily influenced by the size of the dataset. Conversely, GAN models trained on balanced datasets with a larger number of samples show less bias across different attributes.

Synthetic data generation (from real data using machine learning) is discussed in detail as a promising privacy-preserving approach. To fully achieve their goals, privacy-preserving methods should form part of a wider comprehensive socio-technical framework for the appropriate disclosure, use and dissemination of data containing personal identifiable information. Select highlights are also presented from a related December 2021 AAG (American Association of Geographers) webinar that explored ethical and other issues surrounding the use of geospatial data to address public health issues during challenging crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - This paper introduces an innovative framework for the development of multi-sensor datasets for target recognition. This framework goes beyond the paradigm of generating synthetic data to augment algorithm training; it employs carefully generated training and test data to characterize algorithm performance over any desired operating conditions, culminating in the ability to generate algorithm performance models for use in fusion, sensor resource management, and mission simulation. The current system instantiates the full path, from operating conditions to synthetic data to results, for synthetic aperture radar. Fully integrated electro-optic and laser radar paths, to be completed in 2019, will comprise a complete multi-sensor testbed for performance prediction. Future work will add sensor modes as well as automated decision and feature fusion for target identification.

AB  - Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottle recycling is a highly automated task; however, manual quality control is required due to inefficiencies of the process. In this paper, we explore automation of the quality control sub-task, namely visual bottle detection, using convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods and synthetic generation of labelled training data. We propose a synthetic generation pipeline tailored for transparent and crushed PET bottle detection; however, it can also be applied to undeformed bottles if the viewpoint is set from above. We conduct various experiments on CNNs to compare the quality of real and synthetic data, show that synthetic data can reduce the amount of real data required and experiment with the combination of both datasets in multiple ways to obtain the best performance.

AB  - Genetic data is limited and generating new datasets is often an expensive, time-consuming process, involving countless moving parts to genotype and phenotype individuals. While sharing data is beneficial for quality control and software development, privacy and security are of utmost importance. Generating synthetic data is a practical solution to mitigate the cost, time and sensitivities that hamper developers and researchers in producing and validating novel biotechnological solutions to data intensive problems. Existing methods focus on mutation frequencies at specific loci while ignoring epistatic interactions. Alternatively, programs that do consider epistasis are limited to two-way interactions or apply genomic constraints that make synthetic data generation arduous or computationally intensive. To solve this, we developed Polygenic Epistatic Phenotype Simulator (PEPS). Our tool is a probabilistic model that can generate synthetic phenotypes with a controllable level of complexity.

AB  - To have any chance of application in real world, advanced manufacturing research in data analytics needs to explore and prove itself with real-world manufacturing data. Limited access to real-world data largely contrasts with the need for data of varied types and larger quantity for research. Use of virtual data is a promising approach to make up for the lack of access. This paper explores the issues, identifies challenges, and suggests requirements and desirable features in the generation of virtual data. These issues, requirements, and features can be used by researchers to build virtual data generators and gain experience that will provide data to data scientists while avoiding known or potential problems. This, in turn, will lead to better requirements and features in future virtual data generators.

AB  - Brauneck and colleagues have combined technical and legal perspectives in their timely and valuable paper "Federated Machine Learning, Privacy-Enhancing Technologies, and Data Protection Laws in Medical Research: Scoping Review." Researchers who design mobile health (mHealth) systems must adopt the same privacy-by-design approach that privacy regulations (eg, General Data Protection Regulation) do. In order to do this successfully, we will have to overcome implementation challenges in privacy-enhancing technologies such as differential privacy. We will also have to pay close attention to emerging technologies such as private synthetic data generation.

AB  - Machine learning methods for multi-target regression (MTR) rely on the hypothesis that an inter-target correlation can improve predictive performance. In the last years, many MTR methods were developed, but there are still questions about how their performances are influenced by the datasets characteristics such as linearity, number of targets, and inter-correlation complexity. Aiming at contributing to the understanding of the relationship between the dataset properties and MTR methods, we generated 33 synthetic datasets with controlled characteristics and tested their performance with single-target and six MTR methods. The results showed that MTR methods were able to improve performance even in datasets whose targets were not linearly correlated among them, but the predictive improvement differed among the combinations of method/regressor according to the dataset composition.

AB  - This paper describes a data generator to synthesize sensor observations in the context of environment monitoring. The overall goal of our work is to monitor the well-being of occupant(s) in a home. Sensors are embedded in a smart home to unobtrusively record environmental parameters. Based on the sensor observations, behavior analysis and modeling are performed. Behavior modeling and analysis require large data sets to be collected over long periods of time to achieve the level of accuracy expected. A data generator - was developed based on initial data i.e. data collected over periods lasting weeks to facilitate concurrent data collection, and development of modeling algorithms. The data generator is based on statistical inference techniques to produce models. Variation is introduced into the data by perturbing the models.

TI  - Joint Selection: Adaptively Incorporating Public Information for Private Synthetic Data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND STATISTICS, VOL 238
LA  - English
CP  - 27th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS)
AB  - Mechanisms for generating differentially private synthetic data based on marginals and graphical models have been successful in a wide range of settings. However, one limitation of these methods is their inability to incorporate public data. Initializing a data generating model by pre-training on public data has shown to improve the quality of synthetic data, but this technique is not applicable when model structure is not determined a priori. We develop the mechanism jam-pgm, which expands the adaptive measurements framework to jointly select between measuring public data and private data. This technique allows for public data to be included in a graphical-model-based mechanism. We show that jam-pgm is able to outperform both publicly assisted and non publicly assisted synthetic data generation mechanisms even when the public data distribution is biased.

TI  - CONVERSER: Few-Shot Conversational Dense Retrieval with Synthetic Data Generation
T2  - 24TH MEETING OF THE SPECIAL INTEREST GROUP ON DISCOURSE AND DIALOGUE, SIGDIAL 2023
LA  - English
CP  - 24rd Annual Meeting of the Special Interest Group on Discourse and Dialogue (SIGDIAL)
AB  - Conversational search provides a natural interface for information retrieval (IR). Recent approaches have demonstrated promising results in applying dense retrieval to conversational IR. However, training dense retrievers requires large amounts of in-domain paired data. This hinders the development of conversational dense retrievers, as abundant in-domain conversations are expensive to collect. In this paper, we propose CONVERSER, a framework for training conversational dense retrievers with at most 6 examples of in-domain dialogues. Specifically, we utilize the in-context learning capability of large language models to generate conversational queries given a passage in the retrieval corpus. Experimental results on conversational retrieval benchmarks OR-QuAC and TREC CAsT 19 show that the proposed CONVERSER achieves comparable performance to fully-supervised models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed framework in few-shot conversational dense retrieval.(1)

AB  - We explore the feasibility of using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to automatically learn generative models to generate synthetic packet- and flow header traces for networking tasks (e.g., telemetry, anomaly detection, provisioning). We identify key fidelity, scalability, and privacy challenges and tradeoffs in existing GAN-based approaches. By synthesizing domain-specific insights with recent advances in machine learning and privacy, we identify design choices to tackle these challenges. Building on these insights, we develop an end-to-end framework, NetShare. We evaluate NetShare on six diverse packet header traces and find that: (1) across all distributional metrics and traces, it achieves 46% more accuracy than baselines and (2) it meets users' requirements of downstream tasks in evaluating accuracy and rank ordering of candidate approaches.

TI  - Touchstone: Generating Enormous Query-Aware Test Databases
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2018 USENIX ANNUAL TECHNICAL CONFERENCE
LA  - English
CP  - USENIX Annual Technical Conference (ATC)
AB  - Query-aware synthetic data generation is an essential and highly challenging task, important for database management system (DBMS) testing, database application testing and application-driven benchmarking. Prior studies on query-aware data generation suffer common problems of limited parallelization, poor scalability, and excessive memory consumption, making these systems unsatisfactory to terabyte scale data generation. In order to fill the gap between the existing data generation techniques and the emerging demands of enormous query-aware test databases, we design and implement our new data generator, called Touchstone. Touchstone adopts the random sampling algorithm instantiating the query parameters and the new data generation schema generating the test database, to achieve fully parallel data generation, linear scalability and austere memory consumption. Our experimental results show that Touchstone consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art solution on TPC-H workload by a 1000x speedup without sacrificing accuracy.

AB  - Inspection for cracks is an essential yet labor-intensive aspect of maintenance for structures in active service bridges. Deep learning networks, combined with an abundance of segmented image data representing various types of cracks, enable the development of a computer vision-based solution. Often, segmentation data is scarce and requires a great deal of time to annotate. This paper introduces a novel approach to structural crack detection using synthetic data generation and advanced semantic segmentation models. We employ StyleGAN3 and the Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model (BBDM) to create a diverse and realistic dataset of synthetic structural crack images, addressing the critical challenge of creating segmentation data in training deep learning models for crack detection. Our methodology is based upon the DeepLabV3+, i.e., a semantic segmentation architecture that builds on DeepLabv3 by adding a simple yet effective decoder module to enhance segmentation results. The original DeepLabV3+ model is insufficient and thus, we first perform a meticulous hyperparameter tuning, which is responsible for about a 10% increase in overall performance. Next, we generate multiple image-to-image translations with BBDMs synthetic datasets and pair them with a set of fine-selected data augmentation techniques, including motion, zoom, and defocus blur, to improve crack segmentation performance. When compared to the state-of-the-art latest work on the same database that achieved an accuracy of 61.49%, our proposed work attains a Mean Intersection over Union (MeanIoU) accuracy of 65.62% through ensemble modeling on multiple synthesized datasets, employing a majority voting strategy. We also showcase the potential of diffusion models in synthetically generated datasets that elevate semantic segmentation accuracy and introduce blur augmentation as a viable technique for enhancing model robustness. The results indicate that our approach not only surpasses conventional methods in terms of MeanIoU but also offers a new avenue of research into diffusion-model-based synthetic image generation for improved semantic segmentation performance.

AB  - Context. Realistic synthetic observations of theoretical source models are essential for our understanding of real observational data. In using synthetic data, one can verify the extent to which source parameters can be recovered and evaluate how various data corruption effects can be calibrated. These studies are the most important when proposing observations of new sources, in the characterization of the capabilities of new or upgraded instruments, and when verifying model-based theoretical predictions in a direct comparison with observational data.
   Aims. We present the SYnthetic Measurement creator for long Baseline Arrays (SYMBA), a novel synthetic data generation pipeline for Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations. SYMBA takes into account several realistic atmospheric, instrumental, and calibration effects.
   Methods. We used SYMBA to create synthetic observations for the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), a millimetre VLBI array, which has recently captured the first image of a black hole shadow. After testing SYMBA with simple source and corruption models, we study the importance of including all corruption and calibration effects, compared to the addition of thermal noise only. Using synthetic data based on two example general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) model images of M 87, we performed case studies to assess the image quality that can be obtained with the current and future EHT array for different weather conditions.
   Results. Our synthetic observations show that the effects of atmospheric and instrumental corruptions on the measured visibilities are significant. Despite these effects, we demonstrate how the overall structure of our GRMHD source models can be recovered robustly with the EHT2017 array after performing calibration steps, which include fringe fitting, a priori amplitude and network calibration, and self-calibration. With the planned addition of new stations to the EHT array in the coming years, images could be reconstructed with higher angular resolution and dynamic range. In our case study, these improvements allowed for a distinction between a thermal and a non-thermal GRMHD model based on salient features in reconstructed images.

AB  - Objective Platforms such as DataSHIELD allow users to analyse sensitive data remotely, without having full access to the detailed data items (federated analysis). While this feature helps to overcome difficulties with data sharing, it can make it challenging to write code without full visibility of the data. One solution is to generate realistic, non-disclosive synthetic data that can be transferred to the analyst so they can perfect their code without the access limitation. When this process is complete, they can run the code on the real data. Results We have created a package in DataSHIELD (dsSynthetic) which allows generation of realistic synthetic data, building on existing packages. In our paper and accompanying tutorial we demonstrate how the use of synthetic data generated with our package can help DataSHIELD users with tasks such as writing analysis scripts and harmonising data to common scales and measures.

AB  - Many modern computational approaches to classical problems in quantitative finance are formulated as empirical loss minimization (ERM), allowing direct applications of classical results from statistical machine learning. These methods, designed to directly construct the optimal feedback representation of hedging or investment decisions, are analyzed in this framework demonstrating their effectiveness as well as their susceptibility to generalization error. Use of classical techniques shows that over-training renders trained investment decisions to become anticipative, and proves overlearning for large hypothesis spaces. On the other hand, nonasymptotic estimates based on Rademacher complexity show the convergence for sufficiently large training sets. These results emphasize the importance of synthetic data generation and the appropriate calibration of complex models to market data. A numerically studied stylized example illustrates these possibilities, including the importance of problem dimension in the degree of overlearning, and the effectiveness of this approach.

AB  - Object detection based on artificial intelligence is ubiquitous in today's computer vision research and application. The training of the neural networks for object detection requires large and high-quality datasets. Besides datasets based on image data, datasets derived from point clouds offer several advantages. However, training datasets are sparse and their generation requires a lot of effort, especially in industrial domains. A solution to this issue offers the generation of synthetic point cloud data. Based on the design science research method, the work at hand proposes an approach and its instantiation for generating synthetic point cloud data based on the Unreal Engine. The point cloud quality is evaluated by comparing the synthetic cloud to a real-world point cloud. Within a practical example the applicability of the Unreal Game engine for synthetic point cloud generation could be successfully demonstrated.

AB  - Three-dimensional tissue cytometry is an important technique for quantitative analysis of cell structures in large fluorescence microscopy volumes. Accurate nuclei detection and segmentation is an important step for 3D tissue cytometry. Deep learning methods have shown promising results for nuclei detection and segmentation. However, manually annotating ground truth for training deep learning methods is labor-intensive and not practical for large 3D volumes. In this paper, we propose a 3D nuclei synthesis method, known as 3DSpCycleGAN, for generating 3D ground truth volumes along with corresponding synthetic microscopy volumes. Experimental results using fluorescence microscopy volumes demonstrate that our method generates more realistic 3D volumes when evaluated both visually and quantitatively than previously reported. We also show that using the synthetic volumes generated by 3DSpCycleGAN as training data improves segmentation accuracy for deep learning segmentation techniques.

AB  - The Ebola forecasting challenge organized by the Research and Policy for Infectious Disease Dynamics (RAPIDD) program of the Fogarty International Center relies on synthetic disease datasets generated by numerical simulations of a highly detailed spatially-structured agent-based model. We discuss here the architecture and technical steps of the challenge, leading to datasets that mimic as much as possible the data collection, reporting, and communication process experienced in the 2014-2015 West African Ebola outbreak. We provide a detailed discussion of the model's definition, the epidemiological scenarios' construction, synthetic patient database generation and the data communication platform used during the challenge. Finally we offer a number of considerations and takeaways concerning the extension and scalability of synthetic challenges to other infectious diseases.

AB  - Tabular datasets are ubiquitous in data science applications. Given their importance, it seems natural to apply state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms in order to fully unlock their potential. Here we propose neural network models that represent tabular time series that can optionally leverage their hierarchical structure. This results in two architectures for tabular time series: one for learning representations that is analogous to BERT and can be pre-trained end-to-end and used in downstream tasks, and one that is akin to GPT and can be used for generation of realistic synthetic tabular sequences. We demonstrate our models on two datasets: a synthetic credit card transaction dataset, where the learned representations are used for fraud detection and synthetic data generation, and on a real pollution dataset, where the learned encodings are used to predict atmospheric pollutant concentrations.

AB  - Segmentation of unseen industrial parts is essential for autonomous industrial systems. However, industrial components are texture-less, reflective, and often found in cluttered and unstructured environments with heavy occlusion, which makes it more challenging to deal with unseen objects. To tackle this problem, we present a synthetic data generation pipeline that randomizes textures via domain randomization to focus on the shape information. In addition, we propose an RGB-D Fusion Mask R-CNN with a confidence map estimator, which exploits reliable depth information in multiple feature levels. We transferred the trained model to real-world scenarios and evaluated its performance by making comparisons with baselines and ablation studies. We demonstrate that our methods, which use only synthetic data, could be effective solutions for unseen industrial components segmentation.

AB  - In a context where learning databases of microplastic FTIR spectra are often incomplete, the objective of our work was to test whether a synthetic data generation method could be relevant to fill the gaps. To this end, synthetic spectra were generated to create new databases. The effectiveness of machine learning from these databases was then tested and compared with previous results. The results showed that the creation of synthetic learning databases could avoid, to a certain extent, the need for learning databases of environmental microplastics FTIR spectra. However, some limitations were encountered, for example, when two different chemical classes had very similar reference spectra or when the intensities of the bands associated with fouling became too intense. The FTIR study of the ageing and fouling of microplastics in the natural environment is one of the identified ways that could further improve this approach.

AB  - Scene editing has attracted increasing research interests owing to its valuable applications in the field of photography and entertainment. With style-based GAN being proposed, images can be reasonably edited on specific semantics by manipulating in latent space of the generator. However, existing datasets cannot satisfy the demands of large amounts of diverse data and rich semantic annotations at the same time, which makes the existing method difficult to edit on the content of outdoor scene images. To address these problems, we propose a large-scale, diverse synthetic dataset called "GOS dataset" generated based on a video game, which contains fine-grained semantic annotations. Extensive experiments show that utilizing the features obtained from the annotations of our dataset achieves better performance in outdoor scene editing, especially for distance and viewpoint of scenes, which indicates the extracted features have a certain generalization capability.

AB  - Having more samples belonging to one class than the samples of the other class in data used in a classification task is known as class imbalance problem. Handling class imbalance is crucial since the classifier's performance is highly affected. One of the solution approaches of this problem is to make the data balanced by generating synthetic data. Employing resampling methods is a common way of generating synthetic data. Although adversarial generative networks (GANs) are mainly designed to generate image data, they can also be an alternative to solve the class imbalance problem by generating tabular data.
   This work presents a comparative study of resampling methods with GANs based methods. The performance of machine learning methods improved by 27% if the data is balanced with resampling methods. However, similar performance results were observed with working on imbalanced data if the GANs based methods are employed for synthetic data generation.

AB  - Crop classification using remote sensing data has emerged as a prominent research area in recent decades. Studies have demonstrated that fusing synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical images can significantly enhance the accuracy of classification. However, a major challenge in this field is the limited availability of training data, which adversely affects the performance of classifiers. In agricultural regions, the dominant crops typically consist of one or two specific types, while other crops are scarce. Consequently, when collecting training samples to create a map of agricultural products, there is an abundance of samples from the dominant crops, forming the majority classes. Conversely, samples from other crops are scarce, representing the minority classes. Addressing this issue requires overcoming several challenges and weaknesses associated with the traditional data generation methods. These methods have been employed to tackle the imbalanced nature of training data. Nevertheless, they still face limitations in effectively handling minority classes. Overall, the issue of inadequate training data, particularly for minority classes, remains a hurdle that the traditional methods struggle to overcome. In this research, we explore the effectiveness of a conditional tabular generative adversarial network (CTGAN) as a synthetic data generation method based on a deep learning network, for addressing the challenge of limited training data for minority classes in crop classification using the fusion of SAR-optical data. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed method generates synthetic data with a higher quality, which can significantly increase the number of samples for minority classes, leading to a better performance of crop classifiers. For instance, according to the G-mean metric, we observed notable improvements in the performance of the XGBoost classifier of up to 5% for minority classes. Furthermore, the statistical characteristics of the synthetic data were similar to real data, demonstrating the fidelity of the generated samples. Thus, CTGAN can be employed as a solution for addressing the scarcity of training data for minority classes in crop classification using SAR-optical data.

AB  - When real datasets are difficult to obtain for tasks such as system analysis, or algorithm evaluation, synthetic datasets are commonly used. Techniques for generating such datasets often generate random data for single-table datasets. Such datasets are often inapplicable when it comes to evaluating data mining or machine learning algorithms dealing with relational data. To address this, our earlier works have dealt with the task of generating relational datasets from Probabilistic Relational Models (PRMs), a framework for dealing with probabilistic uncertainties in relational domains. In this article, we extend this work by proposing to use more efficient data sampling algorithms, and by using a spatial extension of PRMs to generate synthetic spatial datasets. We also present our experimental analysis on three different data sampling algorithms applicable in our method, and the quality of the datasets generated by them.

AB  - Generating synthetic data is useful in multiple application areas (e.g., database testing, software testing). Nevertheless, existing synthetic data generators generally lack the necessary mechanism to produce realistic data, unless a complex set of inputs are given from the user, such as the characteristics of the desired data. An automated and efficient technique is needed for generating realistic data. In this paper, we propose ReX, a novel extrapolation system targeting relational data-bases that aims to produce a representative extrapolated database given an original one and a natural scaling rate. Furthermore, we evaluate our system in comparison with an existing realistic scaling method, UpSizeR, by measuring the representativeness of the extrapolated database to the original one, the accuracy for approximate query answering, the database size, and their performance. Results show that our solution significantly outperforms the compared method for all considered dimensions.

AB  - Synthetic data generated through machine learning algorithms from original real-world data is gaining prominence across sectors due to their potential to provide privacy-preserving alternatives to traditional data sources. However, recent studies have raised concerns about the re-identification risks of synthetic data. This article examines the legal challenges surrounding synthetic data protection, with a focus on the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). After briefly explaining the methods of synthetic data generation and discussing their potential for privacy preservation, the article analyses the shortcomings of the personal/non-personal dualist approach under the GDPR. It then assesses the possibility of a paradigm change in data protection legislation, moving beyond this binary categorisation. The article argues in favour of establishing clear guidelines for the generation and processing of synthetic data, prioritising the principles of transparency, accountability and fairness.

AB  - Recent progress in computer vision has been dominated by deep neural networks trained over large amounts of labeled data. Collecting such datasets is however a tedious, often impossible task; hence a surge in approaches relying solely on synthetic data for their training. For depth images however, discrepancies with real scans still noticeably affect the end performance. We thus propose an end-to-end framework which simulates the whole mechanism of these devices, generating realistic depth data from 3D models by comprehensively modeling vital factors e.g. sensor noise, material reflectance, surface geometry. Not only does our solution cover a wider range of sensors and achieve more realistic results than previous methods, assessed through extended evaluation, but we go further by measuring the impact on the training of neural networks for various recognition tasks; demonstrating how our pipeline seamlessly integrates such architectures and consistently enhances their performance.

AB  - The evaluation of camera-based perception functions in automated driving (AD) is a significant challenge and requires large-scale high-quality datasets. Recently proposed metrics for safety evaluation additionally require detailed per-instance annotations of dynamic properties such as distance and velocities that may not be available in openly accessible AD datasets. Synthetic data from 3D simulators like CARLA may provide a solution to this problem as labeled data can be produced in a structured manner. However, CARLA currently lacks instance segmentation ground truth. In this paper, we present a back projection pipeline that allows us to obtain accurate instance segmentation maps for CARLA, which is necessary for precise per-instance ground truth information. Our evaluation results show that per-pedestrian depth aggregation obtained from our instance segmentation is more precise than previously available approximations based on bounding boxes especially in the context of crowded scenes in urban automated driving.

AB  - We propose a methodology to anonymize microdata (i.e. a table of n individuals described by d attributes). The goal is to be able to release an anonymized data table built from the original data that protects against the re-identification risk. The proposed solution combines co-clustering with synthetic data generation to produce anonymized data. Co-clustering is first used to build an aggregated representation of the data. The obtained model, which is also an estimator of the joint distribution of the data, is then used to generate synthetic individuals, in the same format as the original ones. The synthetic individuals can now be released. We show through several experiments that these synthetic data preserve sufficient information to be used in place of the real data for various data mining tasks (supervised classification, exploratory data analysis). Finally, the protection against the re-identification risk is evaluated.

AB  - Clustering is one of the most fundamental unsupervised learning tasks with numerous applications in various fields. Clustering methods based on neural networks, called deep clustering methods, leverage the representational power of neural networks to enhance clustering performance. ClusterGan constitutes a generative deep clustering method that exploits generative adversarial networks (GANs) to perform clustering. However, it inherits some deficiencies of GANs, such as mode collapse, vanishing gradients and training instability. In order to tackle those deficiencies, the generative approach of implicit maximum likelihood estimation (IMLE) has been recently proposed. In this paper, we present a clustering method based on generative neural networks, called neural implicit maximum likelihood clustering, which adopts ideas from both ClusterGAN and IMLE. The proposed method has been compared with ClusterGAN and other neural clustering methods on both synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating promising results.

AB  - The transition of paradigm from non-standalone to standalone mode in 5G network creates an opportunity to utilize innovative machine learning and AI-based technology for network traffic analysis. In particular, NWDAF plays a key role in leveraging AI-based models to optimize and enhance the 5G core network functions, including anomaly detection and load balancing. However, it is challenging to ensure the sufficient performance of prediction algorithms under dynamic conditions in NWDAF without guaranteeing the quality and quantity of training data, but only a select group has access to the 5G dataset. To overcome this issue, this paper proposes an approach to generate high-quality synthetic 5G NWDAF data using CTGAN, a specialized generative model that creates synthetic output based on tabular input data. We provide preliminary results of leveraging CTGAN to generate 5G synthetic data and evaluate the synthesizing quality for anomaly detection.

TI  - Learning deep abdominal CT registration through adaptive loss weighting and synthetic data generation
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
KW  - IMAGE REGISTRATION
AB  - PurposeThis study aims to explore training strategies to improve convolutional neural network-based image-to-image deformable registration for abdominal imaging. MethodsDifferent training strategies, loss functions, and transfer learning schemes were considered. Furthermore, an augmentation layer which generates artificial training image pairs on-the-fly was proposed, in addition to a loss layer that enables dynamic loss weighting. ResultsGuiding registration using segmentations in the training step proved beneficial for deep-learning-based image registration. Finetuning the pretrained model from the brain MRI dataset to the abdominal CT dataset further improved performance on the latter application, removing the need for a large dataset to yield satisfactory performance. Dynamic loss weighting also marginally improved performance, all without impacting inference runtime. ConclusionUsing simple concepts, we improved the performance of a commonly used deep image registration architecture, VoxelMorph. In future work, our framework, DDMR, should be validated on different datasets to further assess its value.

AB  - Imbalanced data sets contain an unequal distribution of data samples among the classes and pose a challenge to the learning algorithms as it becomes hard to learn the minority class concepts. Synthetic oversampling techniques address this problem by creating synthetic minority samples to balance the data set. However, most of these techniques may create wrong synthetic minority samples which fall inside majority regions. In this respect, this paper presents a novel Cluster Based Synthetic Oversampling (CBSO) algorithm. CBSO adopts its basic idea from existing synthetic oversampling techniques and incorporates unsupervised clustering in its synthetic data generation mechanism. CBSO ensures that synthetic samples created via this method always lie inside minority regions and thus, avoids any wrong synthetic sample creation. Simualtion analyses on some real world datasets show the effectiveness of CBSO showing improvements in various assesment metrics such as overall accuracy, F-measure, and G-mean.

AB  - The application of AI methods to industry requires a large amount of training data that covers all situations appearing in practice. It is often a challenge to collect a sufficient amount of such data. An alternative is to artificially generate realistic data based on training examples. In this paper we present a method for generating the electric current time series produced by railway switch engines during switchblades repositioning. In practice, this electrical signal is monitored and can be used to detect unusual behaviour associated to switch faults. The generation method requires a sample of real curves and exploits their systematic temperature dependence to reduce their dimensionality. This is done by extracting the effect of temperature on specific parameters, which are then re-sampled and used to generate new curves. The model is analyzed in different practice-relevant scenarios and shows potential for improving condition monitoring methods.

AB  - Multiphysics simulation of magnetically actuated origami robots promises a range of applications such as synthetic data generation, design parameter optimization, predicting the robot's performance, and implementing various control algorithms, but it has rarely been explored. This letter presents a realistic multiphysics simulation of magnetically actuated origami robots with focus on real-time interactions between the origami and magnets. Due to the interaction between multiple magnets, the complex motion dynamics of a worm-like robot are generated and analyzed. We further show the possibility of accurately simulating origami structures made of different materials and permanent magnets of different shapes, sizes, and magnetic strength. The simulation's unknown parameters are determined by conducting similar practical and simulated experiments and comparing their characteristics. Further, we show the close resemblance between the real and simulated behavior of the origami robot.

TI  - Robust 6D Object Pose Estimation in Cluttered Scenes using Semantic Segmentation and Pose Regression Networks
T2  - 2018 IEEE/RSJ INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT ROBOTS AND SYSTEMS (IROS)

CP  - 25th IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)
AB  - Object pose estimation is a crucial prerequisite for robots to perform autonomous manipulation in clutter. Real-world bin-picking settings such as warehouses present additional challenges, e.g., new objects are added constantly. Most of the existing object pose estimation methods assume that 3D models of the objects is available beforehand. We present a pipeline that requires minimal human intervention and circumvents the reliance on the availability of 3D models by a fast data acquisition method and a synthetic data generation procedure. This work builds on previous work on semantic segmentation of cluttered bin-picking scenes to isolate individual objects in clutter. An additional network is trained on synthetic scenes to estimate object poses from a cropped object-centered encoding extracted from the segmentation results. The proposed method is evaluated on a synthetic validation dataset and cluttered real-world scenes.

AB  - Convolutional Neural Network based models become reliable and efficient, two questions arise in relation to their applications for industrial purposes. The usefulness of these models in industrial environments and their implementation in these settings. This paper describes the autonomous generation of Region based CNN models trained on images from rendered CAD models and examines their applicability and performance for part handling application. The development of the automated synthetic data generation is detailed and two CNN models are trained with the aim to detect a car component and differentiate it against another similar looking part. The performance of these models is tested on real images and it was found that the proposed approach can be easily adopted for detecting a range of parts in arbitrary backgrounds. Moreover, the use of syntheic images for training CNNs automates the process of generating a detector.

AB  - Image processing softwares, like all softwares, need to be both verified and validated. Synthetic images are very useful during the medical software development process to verify the accuracy of algorithms. In this paper we introduce the process of generating synthetic 2D medical X-ray images in addition to ground truth imaging parameters. First, a 3D model of an organ (e.g., vessels) is made in a 3D-modeling software. Then, this volume model is voxelized based on the specified resolution in order to create a 3D CT image of that organ by assigning proper Hounsfield unit to each voxel. The obtained 3D CT image volume is used in DRR program as the input. Geometry parameters such as internal and external parameters are adjusted to take some images from different views. We demonstrated this process by three examples to confirm its usage in validation of medical image processing applications.

AB  - Automatic Post-Editing (APE) aims to correct errors in the output of a given machine translation (MT) system. Although data-driven approaches have become prevalent also in the APE task as in many other NLP tasks, there has been a lack of qualified training data due to the high cost of manual construction. eSCAPE, a synthetic APE corpus, has been widely used to alleviate the data scarcity, but it might not address genuine APE corpora's characteristic that the post-edited sentence should be a minimally edited revision of the given MT output. Therefore, we propose two new methods of synthesizing additional MT outputs by adapting back-translation to the APE task, obtaining robust enlargements of the existing synthetic APE training dataset(1). Experimental results on the WMT English-German APE benchmarks demonstrate that our enlarged datasets are effective in improving APE performance.

AB  - Ground penetrating radar (GPR) is widely studied for detection of landmines and mine-like targets; GPR is particularly useful for detecting minimum metal mines which are harder to detect using traditional metal detection devices alone. In order to expand the phenomenology for GPR, careful measurements of homogeneous and heterogeneous soils with and without targets (landmine simulants and metal objects) are performed in a controlled environment. These measurements will aid in the development of models for soil response beyond the initial air-ground interface. Such explicit models for soil will increase the effectiveness of algorithms designed to discriminate between returns from targets and from naturally occurring geologic materials and interfaces. Furthermore, careful measurement of soil characteristics will enable comparison and refinement of models of soil with embedded targets developed in electromagnetic simulations (using finite-difference time-domain codes (FDTD), e.g.).

AB  - It is critical that the qualities and features of synthetically-generated, PMU measurements used for grid analysis matches those of measurements obtained from field-based PMUs. This ensures that analysis results generated by researchers during grid studies replicate those outcomes typically expected by engineers in real-life situations. In this paper, essential features associated with industry PMU-derived data measurements are analyzed for input considerations in the generation of vast amounts of synthetic power system data. Inherent variabilities in PMU data as a result of the random dynamics in power system operations, oscillatory contents, and the prevalence of bad data are presented. Statistical results show that in the generation of large datasets of synthetic, grid measurements, an inclusion of different data anomalies, ambient oscillation contents, and random cases of missing data samples due to packet drops helps to improve the realism of experimental data used in power systems analysis.

AB  - There is significant growth and interest in the use of synthetic data as an enabler for machine learning in environments where the release of real data is restricted due to privacy or availability constraints. Despite a large number of methods for synthetic data generation, there are comparatively few results on the statistical properties of models learnt on synthetic data, and fewer still for situations where a researcher wishes to augment real data with another party's synthesised data. We use a Bayesian paradigm to characterise the updating of model parameters when learning in these settings, demonstrating that caution should be taken when applying conventional learning algorithms without appropriate consideration of the synthetic data generating process and learning task at hand. Recent results from general Bayesian updating support a novel and robust approach to Bayesian synthetic-learning founded on decision theory that outperforms standard approaches across repeated experiments on supervised learning and inference problems.

AB  - Generative data augmentation (GDA) has emerged as a promising technique to alleviate data scarcity in machine learning applications. This thesis presents a comprehensive survey and unified framework of the GDA landscape. We first provide an overview of GDA, discussing its motivation, taxonomy, and key distinctions from synthetic data generation. We then systematically analyze the critical aspects of GDA-selection of generative models, techniques to utilize them, data selection methodologies, validation approaches, and diverse applications. Our proposed unified framework categorizes the extensive GDA literature, revealing gaps such as the lack of universal benchmarks. The thesis summarizes promising research directions, including , effective data selection, theoretical development for large-scale models' application in GDA and establishing a benchmark for GDA. By laying a structured foundation, this thesis aims to nurture more cohesive development and accelerate progress in the vital arena of generative data augmentation.

AB  - This article aims to compare Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) models and feature selection methods for generating synthetic data in order to improve the validity of a classification model. The synthetic data generation technique involves generating new data samples from existing data to increase the diversity of the data and help the model generalize better. The multidimensional aspect of the data refers to the fact that it can have multiple features or variables that describe it. The GAN models have proven to be effective in preserving the statistical properties of the original data. However, the order of data augmentation and feature selection is crucial to build robust and accurate predictive models. By comparing the different GAN models with feature selection methods on multidimensional datasets, this article aims to determine the best combination to support the validity of a classification model in multidimensional data.

AB  - Synthetic data generation has been widely adopted in software testing, data privacy, imbalanced learning, machine learning explanation, etc. In such contexts, it is important to generate data samples located within "local" areas surrounding specific instances. Local synthetic data can help the learning phase of predictive models, and it is fundamental for methods explaining the local behavior of obscure classifiers. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we introduce a method based on generative operators allowing the synthetic neighborhood generation by applying specific perturbations on a given input instance. The key factor consists in performing a data transformation that makes applicable to any type of data, i.e., data-agnostic. Second, we design a framework for evaluating the goodness of local synthetic neighborhoods exploiting both supervised and unsupervised methodologies. A deep experimentation shows the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB  - Generative AI has seen remarkable growth over the past few years, with diffusion models being state-of-the-art for image generation. This study investigates the use of diffusion models in artificial data generation for electronic circuits to enhance the accuracy of subsequent machine learning models in tasks such as performance assessment, design, and testing when training data is usually known to be very limited. We utilize simulations in the HSPICE design environment with 22nm CMOS technology nodes to obtain representative real training data for our proposed diffusion model. Our results demonstrate the close resemblance of synthetic data using diffusion models to real data. We validate the quality of generated data and demonstrate that data augmentation is certainly effective in the predictive analysis of VLSI design for digital circuits.

AB  - Data-driven algorithms have proven to be effective for a variety of medical tasks, including disease categorization and prediction, personalized medicine design, and imaging diagnostics. Although their performance is frequently on par with that of clinicians, their widespread use is constrained by a number of obstacles, including the requirement for high-quality data that are typical of the population, the difficulty of explaining how they operate, and ethical and regulatory concerns. The use of data augmentation and synthetic data generation methodologies, such as federated learning and explainable artificial intelligence ones, could provide a viable solution to the current issues, facilitating the widespread application of artificial intelligence algorithms in the clinical application domain and reducing the time needed for prevention, diagnosis, and prognosis by up to 70%. To this end, a novel AI-based functional framework is conceived and presented in this paper.

AB  - Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are an important tool to generate synthetic medical data, in order to combat the limited and difficult access to the real data sets and accelerate the innovation in the healthcare domain. Despite their promising capability, they are vulnerable to various privacy attacks that might reveal information of individuals from the training data. Preserving privacy while keeping the quality of the generated data still remains a challenging problem. We propose DP-CTGAN, which incorporates differential privacy into a conditional tabular generative model. Our experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art models under the same privacy budget on several benchmark data sets. In addition, we combine our method with federated learning, enabling a more secure way of synthetic data generation without the need of uploading locally collected data to a central repository.

AB  - Synthetic training data has been extensively used to train Automatic Post-Editing (APE) models in many recent studies because the quantity of human-created data has been considered insufficient. However, the most widely used synthetic APE dataset, eSCAPE, overlooks respecting the minimal editing property of genuine data, and this defect may have been a limiting factor for the performance of APE models. This article suggests adapting back-translation to APE to constrain edit distance, while using stochastic sampling in decoding to maintain the diversity of outputs, to create a new synthetic APE dataset, RESHAPE. Our experiments show that (1) RESHAPE contains more samples resembling genuine APE data than eSCAPE does, and (2) using RESHAPE as new training data improves APE models' performance substantially over using eSCAPE.

These datasets can be used for testing of the algorithms designed for solving classification rule problem. We used them for optimizing of the parameters of the classification algorithm based on the behavior of ant colonies. But they can be advantageously used for other applications too. Program generates output files in ARFF format. Two standards and one user-define probability distributions are used in data generation: uniform distribution, normal distribution and irregular distribution for nominal attributes. To our knowledge, our system is probably the first synthetic data generation system that systematically generates datasets for examination and judgment of the classification rule algorithms.

AB  - Data augmentation is the practice of applying various transformations to existing data to increase their size and diversity without collecting new data. While augmentation strategies are widely recognized and implemented in image-based deep learning (DL) workflows, the degree to which they are effective in the time series domain is unclear. This paper experimentally evaluates the utility of various common time series augmentation techniques, especially those relevant to the medical sector where data limitations are prevalent. We thoroughly examine popular time series augmentation and synthetic data generation methods to evaluate their effectiveness in downstream classification tasks, encompassing both traditional and DL-based approaches. This research aims to offer insights into the applicability and efficacy of data augmentation strategies in improving model generalization and mitigating data scarcity challenges, with a focus on biomedical time-series data.

AB  - The analysis of microscopy images has always been an important yet time consuming process in materials science. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been very successfully used for a number of tasks, such as image segmentation. However, training a CNN requires a large amount of hand annotated data, which can be a problem for material science data. We present a procedure to generate synthetic data based on ad hoc parametric data modelling for enhancing generalization of trained neural network models. Especially for situations where it is not possible to gather a lot of data, such an approach is beneficial and may enable to train a neural network reasonably. Furthermore, we show that targeted data generation by adaptively sampling the parameter space of the generative models gives superior results compared to generating random data points.

AB  - Search typically relies on keyword queries, but these are often semantically ambiguous. We propose to overcome this by offering users natural language questions, based on their keyword queries, to disambiguate their intent. This keyword-to-question task may be addressed using neural machine translation techniques. Neural translation models, however, require massive amounts of training data (keyword-question pairs), which is unavailable for this task. The main idea of this paper is to generate large amounts of synthetic training data from a small seed set of hand-labeled keyword-question pairs. Since natural language questions are available in large quantities, we develop models to automatically generate the corresponding keyword queries. Further, we introduce various filtering mechanisms to ensure that synthetic training data is of high quality. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach using both automatic and manual evaluation.

AB  - The data collected from personal devices is intrinsically private and should be collected through a privacy-guaranteed mechanism. Local differential privacy solves privacy problems by collecting randomized responses from each user, and it does not need to rely on a trusted data aggregator/curator. The proposed approach utilizes the randomized response technique in a novel manner: it guarantees privacy to users during the data collection and simultaneously preserves the high utility of the analysis. It can be seen as a case of synthetic data generation by producing contingency tables (marginals) in a privacy-preserving mechanism. This article describes the proposed randomized response technique and discusses the motivating applications domains. It justifies why it satisfies the property of differential privacy and utility guarantees theoretically and through experimental analysis with excellent results.

AB  - Modern biometric systems based on face recognition demonstrate high recognition quality, but they are vulnerable to face presentation attacks, such as photo or replay attack. Existing face anti-spoofing methods are mostly based on texture analysis and due to lack of training data either use hand-crafted features or fine-tuned pretrained deep models. In this paper we present a novel CNN-based approach for face anti-spoofing, based on joint analysis of the presence of a spoofing medium and eye blinking For training our classifiers we propose the procedure of synthetic data generation which allows us to train powerful deep models from scratch. Experimental analysis on the challenging datasets (CASIA-FASD, NUUA Imposter) shows that our method can obtain state-of-the-art results.

AB  - Chatbots are nowadays being applied widely in different life domains. One major reason for this trend is the mature development process that is supported by large companies and sophisticated conversational platforms. However, the required development steps are mostly done manually while transforming existing knowledge bases into interaction configurations, s.t., algorithms integrated into the conversational platforms are enabled to learn the intended interaction patterns. However, already existing domain knowledge may get vanished while transforming a structured knowledge base into a "flat" text representation without references backwards. In this paper, we aim for an automatic process dedicated to generating interaction configurations for a conversational platform (Google Dialogflow) from an existing domain-specific knowledge base. Our ultimate goal is to generate chatbot configurations automatically, s.t., the quality and efficiency are increased.

KW  - Deep Learning
KW  - Quantization

AB  - Post-training quantization is a representative technique for compressing neural networks, making them smaller and more efficient for deployment on edge devices. However, an inaccessible user dataset often makes it difficult to ensure the quality of the quantized neural network in practice. In addition, existing approaches may use a single uniform bit-width across the network, resulting in significant accuracy degradation at extremely low bit-widths. To utilize multiple bit-width, sensitivity metric plays a key role in balancing accuracy and compression. In this paper, we propose a novel sensitivity metric that considers the effect of quantization error on task loss and interaction with other layers. Moreover, we develop labeled data generation methods that are not dependent on a specific operation of the neural network. Our experiments show that the proposed metric better represents quantization sensitivity, and generated data are more feasible to apply to mixed-precision quantization.

AB  - This document outlines and demonstrates an approach to generating a synthetic email dataset using the Enron email dataset as a reference and the Synthetic Transaction Data Generator (STDG) simulator application. With statistical measures extracted from the Enron dataset, we generate synthetic email threads within the confines of a fictitious corporate structure. Our approach extrapolates the network structure of who communicates with whom and the timing of these communications, but it ignores semantic content. To this end, we first harvest the statistical network and temporal features of the Enron reference dataset. With these features, we use the agent-based STDG application to stochastically generate corporations of arbitrary sizes and email transactions within the corporations over a specified time period. We evaluate our methodology by comparing features of the synthetically generated datasets with those of the reference dataset.

KW  - Sonar Imaging

AB  - Autonomous navigation in underwater environments presents challenges due to factors such as light absorption and water turbidity, limiting the effectiveness of optical sensors. Sonar systems are commonly used for perception in underwater operations as they are unaffected by these limitations. Traditional computer vision algorithms are less effective when applied to sonar-generated acoustic images, while convolutional neural networks (CNNs) typically require large amounts of labeled training data that are often unavailable or difficult to acquire. To this end, we propose a novel compact deep sonar descriptor pipeline that can generalize to real scenarios while being trained exclusively on synthetic data. Our architecture is based on a ResNet18 back-end and a properly parameterized random Gaussian projection layer, whereas input sonar data is enhanced with standard ad-hoc normalization/prefiltering techniques. Acustomized synthetic data generation procedure is also presented. The proposed method has been evaluated extensively using both synthetic and publicly available real data, demonstrating its effectiveness compared to state-of-theart methods.

AB  - The availability of large-scale chest X-ray datasets is a requirement for developing well-performing deep learning-based algorithms in thoracic abnormality detection and classification. However, biometric identifiers in chest radiographs hinder the public sharing of such data for research purposes due to the risk of patient re-identification. To counteract this issue, synthetic data generation offers a solution for anonymizing medical images. This work employs a latent diffusion model to synthesize an anonymous chest X-ray dataset of high-quality class-conditional images. We propose a privacy-enhancing sampling strategy to ensure the non-transference of biometric information during the image generation process. The quality of the generated images and the feasibility of serving as exclusive training data are evaluated on a thoracic abnormality classification task. Compared to a real classifier, we achieve competitive results with a performance gap of only 3.5% in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.

AB  - In recent years, researchers designed several artificial intelligence solutions for healthcare applications, which usually evolved into functional solutions for clinical practice. Furthermore, deep learning (DL) methods are well-suited to process the broad amounts of data acquired by wearable devices, smartphones, and other sensors employed in different medical domains. Conceived to serve the role of diagnostic tool and surgical guidance, hyperspectral images emerged as a non-contact, non-ionizing, and label-free technology. However, the lack of large datasets to efficiently train the models limits DL applications in the medical field. Hence, its usage with hyperspectral images is still at an early stage. We propose a deep convolutional generative adversarial network to generate synthetic hyperspectral images of epidermal lesions, targeting skin cancer diagnosis, and overcome small-sized datasets challenges to train DL architectures. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed framework, capable of generating synthetic data to train DL classifiers.

AB  - Automatic event detection from images or wearable sensors is a fundamental step towards the development of advanced sport analytics and broadcasting software. However, the collection and annotation of large scale sport datasets is hindered by technical obstacles, cost of data acquisition and annotation, and commercial interests. In this paper, we present the Soccer Event Recognition (SoccER) data generator, which builds upon an existing, high quality open source game engine to enable synthetic data generation. The software generates detailed spatio-temporal data from simulated soccer games, along with fine-grained, automatically generated event ground truth. The SoccER software suite includes also a complete event detection system entirely developed and tested on a synthetic dataset including 500 min of game, and more than 1 million events. We close the paper by discussing avenues for future research in sports event recognition enabled by the use of synthetic data. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

KW  - SLIC SUPERPIXELS
AB  - In this paper, we present a multi-step method for performing unsupervised segmentation of hyperspectral imagery using modified clustering algorithms which incorporate both the spatial and spectral information present within the scene. The algorithm does not require apriori knowledge of the number of targets, spectral signatures, or any training data. Instead, the method divides the image into spatially connected regions based solely on an intrinsic notion of spectral similarity. As such, the method is expected to generalize well to many real-world analysis scenarios. The overall runtime complexity of the method is O(n(3)), but the method is amenable to GPU-based parallel computation and algorithmic optimizations which allow for considerable speedup in practice. Using a simplified, synthetic data generation model, we perform Monte Carlo simulations on various images to provide performance metrics in idealized scenarios. Finally, we provide anecdotal evidence of the viability of the method by segmenting several common hyperspectral images found in the literature and providing the graphical result.

AB  - This research paper presents a novel machine learning based approach for generating personalized arms for virtual reality use cases. The approach is fully automatic and not bound to expensive or specialized hardware. To overcome the big amount of data necessary to train machine learning models a synthetic data generation scheme is employed. It is then shown how an image to image machine learning model can be trained via this training data to extract personalized arm textures from only two photographs. Finally the resulting virtual arms are analyzed by conducting an experiment to measure the embodiment of test subjects using these personalized arms in a virtual reality environment. This work represents a notable advancement in the integration of machine learning with virtual reality. It offers a promising step towards more user-centric and immersive VR experiences without necessitating high-end hardware. The findings serve as a foundation for future research aimed at refining and expanding the applicability of personalized virtual environments.

AB  - Imbalanced data often leads to biased models favoring the majority class, limiting the representation of the training data and complicating generalization to minority classes. Previous studies have addressed this problem by rebalancing the dataset using resampling methods, such as SMOTE. However, these methods often encounter challenges such as overfitting and information loss. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach called Angle Radius-Adaptive Synthetic Sampling (AR-ADASYN). The proposed method aims to maintain the distribution of minority classes by taking into account both the distance and the angle between existing samples of the minority class. We conducted experiments on 14 datasets composed of real data to compare the classification performance of the proposed method with other oversampling techniques. The results revealed that the proposed method demonstrated superior classification performance compared to the other oversampling techniques. As a result, AR-ADASYN showed potential as a valuable tool for improving the robustness and generalization of machine learning models trained on imbalanced datasets.

AB  - Preserving privacy in facial recognition systems while maintaining high accuracy is a challenging problem. In this research, we propose a novel method for achieving image privacy with latent space navigation and synthetic data generation. Our approach aims to generate synthetic samples that are ambiguous to recognize for humans while still being correctly classified by the classifier. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on the MNIST dataset, chosen for its interpretability and low dimensionality. We create latent spaces with different dimensions (10-D, 30-D, and 50-D) through an encoder-decoder architecture, enabling controlled sampling close to class boundaries. Our optimization technique ensures privacy protection by producing diverse and confusing images that the MNIST digit classifier can correctly identify. The results of our study serve as a foundation for future research in privacy-preserving facial recognition systems, offering a promising direction to safeguard user privacy without compromising classifier accuracy.

AB  - Early diagnosis of cancer in polyps detected in the endoscopic video frames helps in better prognosis and clinical management. For this, the polyp regions are exhaustively analyzed by an endoscopist. In this paper, an automated polyp classifier in a deep learning framework is proposed. As the availability of ground truth data for colonic polyp is always in paucity, data augmentation is indispensable in such task. Our work proposes the use of Generative adversial networks (GANs) for synthetic data generation. For classification, a CNN is trained which discriminate between normal (benign) and cancer (malignanat) polyps. Experiments carried on two databases prove that the proposed data augmentation technique can efficiently be used in the classification of colonic polyps. Also, our proposed method compares the performance achieved using classical augmentation approach which is generally considered in limited data scenario. Experimental results show that the classification accuracy is competitive to the state-of-the-art methods.

CP  - 16th IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)
KW  - SEPARATION
AB  - This paper proposes a deep neural network structure that exploits edge information in addressing representative low-level vision tasks such as layer separation and image filtering. Unlike most other deep learning strategies applied in this context, our approach tackles these challenging problems by estimating edges and reconstructing images using only cascaded convolutional layers arranged such that no handcrafted or application-specific image-processing components are required. We apply the resulting transferrable pipeline to two different problem domains that are both sensitive to edges, namely, single image reflection removal and image smoothing. For the former, using a mild reflection smoothness assumption and a novel synthetic data generation method that acts as a type of weak supervision, our network is able to solve much more difficult reflection cases that cannot be handled by previous methods. For the latter, we also exceed the state-of-the-art quantitative and qualitative results by wide margins. In all cases, the proposed framework is simple, fast, and easy to transfer across disparate domains.

AB  - The rapid evolution of large language models, in particular OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4, indicates a growing interest in advanced computational methodologies. This paper proposes a novel approach to synthetic data generation and knowledge distillation through prompt engineering. The potential of large language models (LLMs) is used to address the problem of unbalanced training datasets for other machine learning models. This is not only a common issue but also a crucial determinant of the final model quality and performance. Three prompting strategies have been considered: basic, composite, and similarity prompts. Although the initial results do not match the performance of comprehensive datasets, the similarity prompts method exhibits considerable promise, thus outperforming other methods. The investigation of our rebalancing methods opens pathways for future research on leveraging continuously developed LLMs for the enhanced generation of high-quality synthetic data. This could have an impact on many large-scale engineering applications.

AB  - Code-switch language modeling is challenging due to data scarcity as well as expanded vocabulary that involves two languages. We present a novel computational method to generate synthetic code-switch data using the Matrix Language Frame theory to alleviate the issue of data scarcity. The proposed method makes use of augmented parallel data to supplement the real code-switch data. We use the synthetic data to pre-train the language model. We show that the pre-trained language model can match the performance of vanilla models when it is fine-tuned with 2.5 times less real code-switch data. We also show that the perplexity of a RNN based language model pre-trained on synthetic code-switch data and fine-tuned with real code-switch data is significantly lower than that of the model trained on real code-switch data alone and the reduction in perplexity translates into 1.45% absolute reduction in WER in a speech recognition experiment.

AB  - The University of Johannesburg has integrated serious games into its teaching, exemplified by Codebreakers, a 2D game teaching information theory. While successful, Codebreakers lacked personalisation and used a criticised assessment method based on answer streaks. Knowledge tracing algorithms, known for their effectiveness in intelligent tutoring systems, were considered to address these limitations. This led to the research question: "Can a new serious game be designed, incorporating knowledge tracing algorithms to deliver personalised learning experiences in telecommunications education?" In response, an escape-themed serious game was developed, integrating Bayesian Knowledge Tracing as a statistical student model for personalised learning. This innovative approach combines free-roam gameplay with tailored educational content, significantly advancing serious game design. While primarily aimed at enhancing Codebreakers, this new game contributes substantially to serious game theory by successfully implementing personalised learning within an engaging format. The project showcases the potential of knowledge tracing algorithms in creating adaptive, student-centered learning experiences within the context of educational games.

AB  - How to bridge heterogeneous gap between different modalities is one of the main challenges in cross-modal retrieval task. Most existing methods try to tackle this problem by projecting data from different modalities into a common space. In this paper, we introduce a novel X-Shaped Generative Adversarial Cross-Modal Network (X-GACMN) to learn a better common space between different modalities. Specifically, the proposed architecture combines the process of synthetic data generation and distribution adapting into a unified framework to make sure the heterogeneous modality distributions similar to each other in the learned common subspace. To promote the discriminative ability, a new loss function that combines intra-modality angular softmax loss and cross-modality pair-wise consistent loss is further imposed on the common space, hence the learned features can well preserve both inter-modality structure and intra-modality structure on a hypersphere manifold. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB  - Face recognition remains challenged by data limitations in both scale and diversity, coupled with the ethical dilemmas of using images without the subjects' consent. To address these issues, this paper presents the SegTex framework, a cutting-edge method for generating synthetic face datasets by converting Segmentation maps into Textured images. Using the CelebAHQ-Mask dataset for segmentation maps and extracting facial features from the CelebAMask-HQ dataset, the SegTex method efficiently creates varied synthetic facial characteristics. This approach not only sidesteps the need for real-world data collection but also offers a rich and diverse dataset, essential for improving face recognition algorithm performance. In our experiments, models trained on the SegTex-generated dataset displayed superior performance metrics when compared to those trained on conventional datasets, underscoring the practical utility of our method. This robust performance, combined with the ethical advantages of synthetic data generation, ensures our approach holds significant importance in the field of face recognition.

AB  - In this paper, we present a deep learning-based approach to detect and identify multiple fasteners from various camera poses. To distinguish fasteners of similar size and shape from each other, we propose a part identifier network and simple visual calibration method using a reference image. Though the camera poses changes, the model can infer the actual scale of detected parts by just capturing a reference object at once. Also, we present a synthetic data generation pipeline that adopts domain randomization and can automatically generate a training set for various fastener identification. In the experiment, we evaluated the real-world performance of the fully synthetically trained model and showed that it could be directly applied to real-world part identification. This indicates that our approach has the potential to accelerate the model retraining procedure for various part identification tasks since data acquisition requires almost no cost.

AB  - Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have become a popular research topic in many research fields in the last decade. The fragmented body of knowledge on GANs drives researchers to a trial -and -error procedure while choosing the right GAN for a given task. This study provides a comprehensive guide on GANs, where we start with considering problems such as nonconvergence, mode collapse, vanishing gradient, and unstable training. We then compare various GANs concerning the application perspective, their outputs, and evaluation metrics. In addition, we suggest using a new evaluation metric to identify the best candidate of GANs for time series tasks, the so-called average coverage error (ACE). Finally, we discuss the application of the ACE using the electricity consumption of an individual industry customer and display significant selection criteria. The ACE is beneficial in identifying the best GANs by comparing outcomes and reduces the computational cost of searching related to the evaluation metrics.

AB  - This paper presents a novel, unified approach for generating high-quality datasets for training machine-learned models for real-time security assessment in power systems. Synthetic data generation methods that extrapolate beyond historical data can be inefficient in generating feasible and rare operating conditions (OCs). The proposed approach balances the trade-off between historically relevant OCs and rare but feasible OCs. Unlike conventional methods that rely on historical records or generic sampling, our approach results in datasets that generalise well beyond similar distributions. The proposed approach is validated through experiments on the IEEE 118-bus system, where a decision tree model trained on data generated using our approach achieved 97 % accuracy in predicting the security label of rare OCs, outperforming baseline approaches by 41 % and 20%. This work is crucial for deploying reliable machine-learned models for real-time security assessment in power systems undergoing decarbonisation and integrating renewable energy sources.

AB  - Task-oriented dialogue systems often assist users with personal or confidential matters. For this reason, the developers of such a system are generally prohibited from observing actual usage. So how can they know where the system is failing and needs more training data or new functionality? In this work, we study ways in which realistic user utterances can be generated synthetically, to help increase the linguistic and functional coverage of the system, without compromising the privacy of actual users. To this end, we propose a two-stage Differentially Private (DP) generation method which first generates latent semantic parses, and then generates utterances based on the parses. Our proposed approach improves MAUVE by 2.5x and parse tree function type overlap by 1.3xrelative to current approaches for private synthetic data generation, improving both on fluency and semantic coverage. We further validate our approach on a realistic domain adaptation task of adding new functionality from private user data to a semantic parser, and show overall gains of 8.5% points in accuracy with the new feature.

AB  - A CNN based method for cardiac MRI tag tracking was developed and validated. A synthetic data simulator was created to generate large amounts of training data using natural images, a Bloch equation simulation, a broad range of tissue properties, and programmed ground-truth motion. The method was validated using both an analytical deforming cardiac phantom and in vivo data with manually tracked reference motion paths. In the analytical phantom, error was investigated relative to SNR, and accurate results were seen for SNR>10 (displacement error <0.3 mm). Excellent agreement was seen in vivo for tag locations (mean displacement difference = -0.02 pixels, 95% CI [-0.73, 0.69]) and calculated cardiac circumferential strain (mean difference = 0.006, 95% CI [- 0.012, 0.024]). Automated tag tracking with a CNN trained on synthetic data is both accurate and precise. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V.

KW  - Domain gap
AB  - To train Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)-based methods, suitable training data are key to help DNNs learn appropriate pattern recognition features. The use of synthetic data may help in generating sufficient and balanced data. However, models trained with such data often present a domain gap when applied to real-world scenarios. Many studies focus on techniques such as domain adaptation to minimize this gap, but little attention is paid to the data generation itself. Our work shows that this gap can be minimized by enhancing the generated data features. More specifically, we generate different synthetic training datasets with particular features and use them to train a DNN for people detection in large spaces using omnidirectional cameras. Experimental results with real-world data show that proper synthetic data minimize the domain gap. We also show that expanding a training dataset to include synthetic samples in addition to real samples, can improve the model's capabilities.

Leveraging recent advancements in computer vision and the affordability of cameras, our research addresses the challenge of automated pallet detection in factory settings. We propose an innovative approach that combines synthetic data generation with domain adaptation techniques. The integration of synthetic and real-world unlabeled data, guided by domain adversarial training, overcomes challenges related to data scarcity and domain shift. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in classifying pallet states. The results showcase the model's adaptability to real-world variations, achieving impressive accuracy. Our work not only optimizes resource allocation in warehouses but also offers a blueprint for the seamless integration of Computer Vision into broader logistics applications.

AB  - Money laundering is a profound global problem. Nonetheless, there is little scientific literature on statistical and machine learning methods for anti-money laundering. In this paper, we focus on anti-money laundering in banks and provide an introduction and review of the literature. We propose a unifying terminology with two central elements: (i) client risk profiling and (ii) suspicious behavior flagging. We find that client risk profiling is characterized by diagnostics, i.e., efforts to find and explain risk factors. On the other hand, suspicious behavior flagging is characterized by non-disclosed features and hand-crafted risk indices. Finally, we discuss directions for future research. One major challenge is the need for more public data sets. This may potentially be addressed by synthetic data generation. Other possible research directions include semi-supervised and deep learning, interpretability, and fairness of the results.

AB  - We present a generic and robust sim-to-real deep-learning-based framework, namely S2R-Pick, for fast and accurate object recognition and localization in industrial robotic bin picking. Unlike existing works designed for general everyday environments, objects for industrial bin picking are often texture-less, metallic, and also suffer from severe occlusion and cluttering. In this work, we first develop an automated synthetic data generation pipeline to produce large-scale photo-realistic data with precise annotations. We then formulate an instance segmentation network for object recognition and a 6D pose estimation network for localization. We cascade and train the two networks only on our generated synthetic data and can directly transfer them for processing real inputs without needing to retrain them on real samples. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness and superiority of our framework over state-of-the-art methods.

KW  - WRITER ADAPTATION
AB  - Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) is still a challenging problem because it must deal with two important difficulties: the variability among writing styles, and the scarcity of labelled data. To alleviate such problems, synthetic data generation and data augmentation are typically used to train HTR systems. However, training with such data produces encouraging but still inaccurate transcriptions in real words. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised writer adaptation approach that is able to automatically adjust a generic handwritten word recognizer, fully trained with synthetic fonts, towards a new incoming writer. We have experimentally validated our proposal using five different datasets, covering several challenges (i) the document source: modern and historic samples, which may involve paper degradation problems; (ii) different handwriting styles: single and multiple writer collections; and (iii) language, which involves different character combinations. Across these challenging collections, we show that our system is able to maintain its performance, thus, it provides a practical and generic approach to deal with new document collections without requiring any expensive and tedious manual annotation step.

AB  - Widespread interest in artificial intelligence (AI) in health care has focused mainly on deductive systems that analyze available real-world data to discover patterns not otherwise visible. Generative adversarial network, a new type of inductive AI, has recently evolved to generate high-fidelity virtual synthetic data (SD) trained on relatively limited real-world information. The AI system is fed with a collection of real data, and it learns to generate new augmented data while maintaining the general characteristics of the original data set. The use of SD to enhance clinical research and protect patient privacy has drawn a lot of interest in medicine and in the complex field of oncology. This article summarizes the main characteristics of this innovative technology and critically discusses how it can be used to accelerate data access for secondary purposes, providing an overview of the opportunities and challenges of SD generation for clinical cancer research and health care.

AB  - The reconstruction of a watertight surface mesh from point clouds is a difficult problem. Constructing a watertight model from a polygonal mesh is just as difficult since there can be many issues in these models, such as intersecting surfaces and non-manifold geometry. We first describe a complete repair process for a single CAD object, resulting in a repaired static model. Next, we implement a novel workflow that can be used to repair local issues on almost every model, allowing one to use global repair methods on local areas of the model. This workflow can be applied to an assembly of CAD objects to retain articulations in the final repaired dynamic model. We introduce methods from Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to show that topological features can be used in the definition of robust mesh metrics, to characterize and determine quality of meshes, and to implement fully-automated watertight & repair of CAD meshes.

AB  - Tattoos have been successfully employed to assist law enforcement in the identification of criminals and victims. Due to various privacy issues in acquiring images containing tattoos, only a limited number of databases exist. This lack of databases has slowed down the development of new tattoo segmentation and retrieval methods. In our work, we propose a new unsupervised generator that allows generating a large number of semi-synthetic images with tattooed subjects. To successfully generate realistic images, a database including the respective skin segmentation map is also proposed. Using this new generator and the skin database, 5,500 semi-synthetic images were created and evaluated for the tattoo segmentation use case. Experimental results on real data show the usefulness of using semi-synthetic images to train semantic segmentation algorithms: several manually mislabelled real samples were successfully corrected. The tattoo generator code, the skin database and generated images have been made available at https://dasec.h-da.de/hda-sstd/.

AB  - We introduce a camera relocalization pipeline that combines absolute pose regression (APR) and direct feature matching. By incorporating exposure-adaptive novel view synthesis, our method successfully addresses photometric distortions in outdoor environments that existing photometric-based methods fail to handle. With domain-invariant feature matching, our solution improves pose regression accuracy using semi-supervised learning on unlabeled data. In particular, the pipeline consists of two components: Novel View Synthesizer and DFNet. The former synthesizes novel views compensating for changes in exposure and the latter regresses camera poses and extracts robust features that close the domain gap between real images and synthetic ones. Furthermore, we introduce an online synthetic data generation scheme. We show that these approaches effectively enhance camera pose estimation both in indoor and outdoor scenes. Hence, our method achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy by outperforming existing single-image APR methods by as much as 56%, comparable to 3D structure-based methods.

TI  - Iterative Methods for Private Synthetic Data: Unifying Framework and New Methods
T2  - ADVANCES IN NEURAL INFORMATION PROCESSING SYSTEMS 34 (NEURIPS 2021)
LA  - English
CP  - 35th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS)
AB  - We study private synthetic data generation for query release, where the goal is to construct a sanitized version of a sensitive dataset, subject to differential privacy, that approximately preserves the answers to a large collection of statistical queries. We first present an algorithmic framework that unifies a long line of iterative algorithms in the literature. Under this framework, we propose two new methods. Our first method, generative networks with the exponential mechanism (GEM), circumvents computational bottlenecks in algorithms such as MWEM by optimizing over generative models parameterized by neural networks, which capture a rich family of distributions while enabling fast gradient-based optimization. The second method, private entropy projection (PEP), can be viewed as an advanced variant of MWEM that adaptively reuses past query measurements to boost accuracy. We demonstrate that GEM and PEP empirically outperform existing algorithms. Furthermore, we show that GEM nicely incorporates prior information from public data while overcoming limitations of PMWPub, the existing state-of-the-art method that also leverages public data.

AB  - Synthetic datasets can be useful in a variety of situations, specifically when new machine learning models and training algorithms are developed or when trying to seek the weaknesses of an specific method. In contrast to real-world data, synthetic datasets provide a controlled environment for analysing concrete critic points such as outlier tolerance, data dimensionality influence and class imbalance, among others. In this paper, a framework for synthetic data generation is developed with special attention to pattern order in the space, data dimensionality, class overlapping and data multimodality. Variables such as position, width and overlapping of data distributions in the n-dimensional space are controlled by considering them as n-spheres. The method is tested in the context of ordinal regression, a paradigm of classification where there is an order arrangement between categories. The contribution of the paper is the full control over data topology and over a set of relevant statistical properties of the data.

AB  - Fuel level gauging in aircraft presents a significant flight mechanics challenge due to the influence of aircraft movements on measurements. Moreover, it constitutes a multidimensional problem where various sensors distributed within the tank must converge to yield a precise and single measurement, independent of the aircraft's attitude. Furthermore, fuel distribution across multiple tanks of irregular geometries complicates the readings even further. These issues critically impact safety and economy, as gauging errors may compromise flight security and lead to carrying excess weight. In response to these challenges, this research introduces a multi-stage project in aircraft fuel gauging systems, as a continuum of studies, where this first article presents a computational tool designed to simulate aircraft fuel sensor data readings as a function of fuel level, fuel tank geometry, sensor location, and aircraft attitude. Developed in an open-source environment, the tool aims to support the statistical inference required for accurate modeling in which synthetic data generation becomes a crucial component. A discretization procedure accurately maps fuel tank geometries and their mass properties. The tool, then, intersects these geometries with fuel-level planes and calculates each new volume. It integrates descriptive geometry to intersect these fuel planes with representative capacitive level-sensing probes and computes the sensor readings for the simulated flight conditions. The method is validated against geometries with analytical solutions. This process yields detailed fuel measurement responses for each sensor inside the tank, and for different analyzed fuel levels, providing insights into the sensors' signals' non-linear behavior at each analyzed aircraft attitude. The non-linear behavior is also influenced by the sensor saturation readings at 0 when above the fuel level and at 1 when submerged. The synthetic fuel sensor readings lay the baseline for a better understanding on how to compute the true fuel level from multiple sensor readings, and ultimately optimizing the amount of used sensors and their placement. The tool's design offers significant improvements in aircraft fuel gauging accuracy, directly impacting aerostructures and instrumentation, and it is a key aspect of flight safety, fuel management, and navigation in aerospace technology.

TI  - Controllable 3D Generative Adversarial Face Model via Disentangling Shape and Appearance
T2  - 2023 IEEE/CVF WINTER CONFERENCE ON APPLICATIONS OF COMPUTER VISION (WACV)
LA  - English
CP  - 23rd IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV)
AB  - 3D face modeling has been an active area of research in computer vision and computer graphics, fueling applications ranging from facial expression transfer in virtual avatars to synthetic data generation. Existing 3D deep learning generative models (e.g., VAE, GANs) allow generating compact face representations (both shape and texture) that can model non-linearities in the shape and appearance space (e.g., scatter effects, specularities,..). However, they lack the capability to control the generation of subtle expressions. This paper proposes a new 3D face generative model that can decouple identity and expression and provides granular control over expressions. In particular, we propose using a pair of supervised auto-encoder and generative adversarial networks to produce high-quality 3D faces, both in terms of appearance and shape. Experimental results in the generation of 3D faces learned with holistic expression labels, or Action Unit (AU) labels, show how we can decouple identity and expression; gaining fine-control over expressions while preserving identity.

AB  - We propose a fully automatic approach to restore aged old line drawings. We decompose the task into two subtasks: the line extraction subtask, which aims to extract line fragments and remove the paper texture background, and the restoration subtask, which fills in possible gaps and deterioration of the lines to produce a clean line drawing. Our approach is based on a convolutional neural network that consists of two sub-networks corresponding to the two subtasks. They are trained as part of a single framework in an end-to-end fashion. We also introduce a new dataset consisting of manually annotated sketches by Leonardo da Vinci which, in combination with a synthetic data generation approach, allows training the network to restore deteriorated line drawings. We evaluate our method on challenging 500-year-old sketches and compare with existing approaches with a user study, in which it is found that our approach is preferred 72.7% of the time.

AB  - Training gesture recognizers with synthetic data generated from real gestures is a well known and powerful technique that can significantly improve recognition accuracy. In this paper we introduce a novel technique called gesture path stochastic resampling (GPSR) that is computationally efficient, has minimal coding overhead, and yet despite its simplicity is able to achieve higher accuracy than competitive, state-of-the-art approaches. GPSR generates synthetic samples by lengthening and shortening gesture subpaths within a given sample to produce realistic variations of the input via a process of nonuniform resampling. As such, GPSR is an appropriate rapid prototyping technique where ease of use, understandability, and efficiency are key. Further, through an extensive evaluation, we show that accuracy significantly improves when gesture recognizers are trained with GPSR synthetic samples. In some cases, mean recognition errors are reduced by more than 70%, and in most cases, GPSR outperforms two other evaluated state-of-the-art methods.

AB  - We present a framework to generate synthetic historical documents with precise ground truth using nothing more than a collection of unlabeled historical images. Obtaining large labeled datasets is often the limiting factor to effectively use supervised deep learning methods for Document Image Analysis (DIA). Prior approaches towards synthetic data generation either require human expertise or result in poor accuracy in the synthetic documents. To achieve high precision transformations without requiring expertise, we tackle the problem in two steps. First, we create template documents with user-specified content and structure. Second, we transfer the style of a collection of unlabeled historical images to these template documents while preserving their text and layout. We evaluate the use of our synthetic historical documents in a pre-training setting and find that we outperform the baselines (randomly initialized and pre-trained). Additionally, with visual examples, we demonstrate a high-quality synthesis that makes it possible to generate large labeled historical document datasets with precise ground truth.

A new plug-in for the computer graphics modelling software Blender was developed that can generate large numbers of photo-realistic ray-traced images and include meta information as training labels. The performance of the deep neural network DetectNet is evaluated using training data comprising synthetically rendered images and digital photos of drinking glasses. The detection accuracy is determined by comparing bounding boxes using intersection over union technique. The detection experiments using real-world and synthetic image data resulted in comparable results and the performance increased when using a pre-trained GoogLeNet model. The experiments demonstrated that training deep neural networks for object detection on synthetic data is effective and the proposed approach can be useful for generating large labelled image data sets to enhance the performance of deep neural networks on specific object detection tasks.

AB  - The steady growth in the utilisation of wind power for electricity generation has led to increased interest in methods for synthetically generating wind speeds that are able to more accurately determine the site potential.
   The aim of this work is to develop a parametric model for generating hourly wind speed, that uses readily available aggregate statistical data, such as mean and maximum monthly or yearly wind speeds. The model has been validated using wind speed measurements collected during an experimental campaign at a site in Italy. To assess performance differences with respect to an already established methodology, the series of wind speeds generated with the proposed approach has been compared with that obtained using the Markov chains method. Various comparison criteria have been considered, including the overall statistical parameters, distribution function, autocorrelation, and power spectral density. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Increasing amounts of data require improvements in effectiveness and efficiency of forensic tools. If new tools have been developed, they have to be evaluated, e. g. by applying test data. 3LSPG has recently been proposed as a framework for generating synthetic test data by simulating activities of subjects using Markov chains. However, the generation of test data should also be efficient. In this paper, we show how to improve the efficiency of 3LSPG considerably compared to its original proposal. We show how to speed-up the calculation of state transition probabilities in the Markov model of 3LSPG by proposing an algorithm that is much faster and more reliable than the one originally used. The simplex algorithm serves as basis for our algorithm although it is typically used for the different purpose of solving optimization problems. Our algorithm helps to enable the creation of synthetic data for forensic tool testing with 3LSPG in significantly shorter time.

AB  - This study proposes a synthetic data framework to decrease the cost of smart metering. It offers clustering of real-time buses based on their electricity consumption levels and synthetic data generated by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to provide sufficient information and data in grid modeling. GANs can be used to predict the electrical dissipation profiles of buses and their total energy consumption since they replicate the distributional features of the recorded data. This study is expected to facilitate energy distribution companies and grid operators in the progress of efficient and intellectual modeling of smart grids by stimulating the bottom-up contribution of end-users. It aims to decrease the data collection cost while allowing realistic scenarios. Furthermore, it introduces a new metric to measure the accuracy of the GANs and illustrates some empirical analysis using single consumer data.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Automatic disease detection and classification have been attracting much interest. High performance is critical in adoption of such systems, which generally rely on training with a wide variety of annotated data. Availability of such varied annotated data in medical imaging is very scarce. Synthetic data generation is a promising solution to address this problem. We propose a novel method, based on generative adversarial networks (GAN), to generate images with lesions such that the overall severity level can be controlled. We demonstrate the reliability of the generated synthetic images independently as well as by training a computer aided diagnosis (CAD) system with the generated data. We showcase this approach for heamorrhage detection in retinal images with 4 levels of severity. Quantitative assessment results show that the generated synthetic images are very close to the real data. Haemorrhage detection was found to improve with inclusion of synthetic data in the training set with improvements in sensitivity ranging from 20% to 27% over training with just expert marked data.

AB  - An investigation of multi-modal fusion schemes is done using synthetic data generation to determine how the data characteristics influence fusion. The goal is to select the best fusion scheme using data characteristics. Preliminary results are presented here that compare data concatenation to Kernel fusion in the presence of increasing dimensionality, linear/nonlinear decision boundaries and correlations between different modality features. It is found that data concatenation is better than Kernel fusion in low dimensions in general. It is also found that Kernel fusion is better than data concatenation when the optimal decision boundary is non-linear, and the dimensions are high. Correlations between modalities determine the information content, and Kernel fusion reduces the information content most when there is negative correlation between modalities. These results are applied to fingerprint live-ness detection on the ATVS database having three sensor modalities. As there are few features used per modality and the overall dimensionality is low, it is expected and confirmed that data concatenation is better than Kernel fusion.

AB  - Synthetic data is essential for assessing clustering techniques, complementing and extending real data, and allowing for more complete coverage of a given problem's space. In turn, synthetic data generators have the potential of creating vast amounts of data - a crucial activity when real-world data is at premium - while providing a well-understood generation procedure and an interpretable instrument for methodically investigating cluster analysis algorithms. Here, we present Clugen, a modular procedure for synthetic data generation, capable of creating multidimensional clusters supported by line segments using arbitrary distributions. Clugen is open source, comprehensively unit tested and documented, and is available for the Python, R, Julia, and MATLAB/Octave ecosystems. We demonstrate that our proposal can produce rich and varied results in various dimensions, is fit for use in the assessment of clustering algorithms, and has the potential to be a widely used framework in diverse clustering-related research tasks.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

T2  - PLOS ONE

KW  - TRANSFORMATION
AB  - With the recent advances in the field of alternate agriculture, there has been an ever-growing demand for aquaponics as a potential substitute for traditional agricultural techniques for improving sustainable food production. However, the lack of data-driven methods and approaches for aquaponic cultivation remains a challenge. The objective of this research is to investigate statistical methods to make inferences using small datasets for nutrient control in aquaponics to optimize yield. In this work, we employed the Density-Based Synthetic Minority Over-sampling TEchnique (DB-SMOTE) to address dataset imbalance, and ExtraTreesClassifer and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to choose the relevant features. Synthetic data generation techniques such as the Monte-Carlo (MC) sampling techniques were used to generate enough data points and different feature engineering techniques were used on the predictors before evaluating the performance of kernel-based classifiers with the goal of controlling nutrients in the aquaponic solution for optimal growth.[27-35]

AB  - This paper performs comprehensive analysis on datasets for occlusion-aware face segmentation, a task that is crucial for many downstream applications. The collection and annotation of such datasets are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Although some efforts have been made in synthetic data generation, the naturalistic aspect of data remains less explored. In our study, we propose two occlusion generation techniques, Naturalistic Occlusion Generation (NatOcc), for producing high-quality naturalistic synthetic occluded faces; and Random Occlusion Generation (RandOcc), a more general synthetic occluded data generation method (Figure 1). We empirically show the effectiveness and robustness of both methods, even for unseen occlusions. To facilitate model evaluation, we present two high-resolution real-world occluded face datasets with fine-grained annotations, RealOcc and RealOcc-Wild, featuring both careful alignment preprocessing and an in-the-wild setting for robustness test. We further conduct a comprehensive analysis on a newly introduced segmentation benchmark, offering insights for future exploration. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/kennyvoo/faceocclusion-generation.

AB  - Recent developments in machine translation and multilingual text generation have led researchers to adopt trained metrics such as COMET or BLEURT, which treat evaluation as a regression problem and use representations from multilingual pre-trained models such as XLM-RoBERTa or mBERT. Yet studies on related tasks suggest that these models are most efficient when they are large, which is costly and impractical for evaluation. We investigate the trade-off between multilinguality and model capacity with RemBERT, a state-of-the-art multilingual language model, using data from the WMT Metrics Shared Task. We present a series of experiments which show that model size is indeed a bottleneck for cross-lingual transfer, then demonstrate how distillation can help addressing this bottleneck, by leveraging synthetic data generation and transferring knowledge from one teacher to multiple students trained on related languages. Our method yields up to 10.5% improvement over vanilla fine-tuning and reaches 92.6% of RemBERT's performance using only a third of its parameters.

AB  - With the recent advances and increasing activities in data mining and analysis, the protection of the privacy of individuals is crucial. Several approaches address this concern, from techniques like data anonymisation to secure, non-disclosive computation, all of which have their specific strengths and weaknesses, depending on the specific requirements. A slightly different approach is the generation of synthetic data, which tries to preserve the overall properties and characteristics of the original data without revealing information about actual individual data samples. The promise is that, for most purposes, models trained on the synthetic data instead of the real data do not show a significant loss of performance. In this paper, we give an overview on currently available approaches for synthetic data generation, and empirically evaluate the utility of the generated synthetic data by testing them on a number of supervised machine learning tasks on several publicly available datasets.

AB  - Recent text-to-image generative models have exhibited remarkable abilities in generating high-fidelity and photo-realistic images. However, despite the visually impressive results, these models often struggle to preserve plausible human structure in the generations. Due to this reason, while generative models have shown promising results in aiding downstream image recognition tasks by generating large volumes of synthetic data, they are not suitable for improving downstream human pose perception and understanding. In this work, we propose a Diffusion model with Human Pose Correction (Diffusion-HPC), a text-conditioned method that generates photo-realistic images with plausible posed humans by injecting prior knowledge about human body structure. Our generated images are accompanied by 3D meshes that serve as ground truths for improving Human Mesh Recovery tasks, where a short-age of 3D training data has long been an issue. Furthermore, we show that Diffusion-HPC effectively improves the realism of human generations under varying conditioning strategies.

AB  - Data is essential for machine learning projects, and data accuracy is crucial for being able to trust the results obtained from the associated machine learning models. Previously, we have developed machine learning models for predicting the treatment outcome for breast cancer patients that have undergone chemotherapy, and developed a monitoring system for their treatment timeline showing interactively the options and associated predictions. Available cancer datasets, such as the one used earlier, are often too small to obtain significant results, and make it difficult to explore ways to improve the predictive capability of the models further. In this paper, we explore an alternative to enhance our datasets through synthetic data generation. From our original dataset, we extract rules to generate fabricated data that capture the different characteristics inherent in the dataset. Additional rules can be used to capture general medical knowledge. We show how to formulate rules for our cancer treatment data, and use the IBM solver to obtain a corresponding synthetic dataset. We discuss challenges for future work.

AB  - In view of the various methodological developments regarding the protection of sensitive data, especially with respect to privacy-preserving computation and federated learning, a conceptual categorization and comparison between various methods stemming from different fields is often desired. More concretely, it is important to provide guidance for the practice, which lacks an overview over suitable approaches for certain scenarios, whether it is differential privacy for interactive queries, k-anonymity methods and synthetic data generation for data publishing, or secure federated analysis for multiparty computation without sharing the data itself. Here, we provide an overview based on central criteria describing a context for privacy-preserving data handling, which allows informed decisions in view of the many alternatives. Besides guiding the practice, this categorization of concepts and methods is destined as a step towards a comprehensive ontology for anonymization. We emphasize throughout the paper that there is no panacea and that context matters.

AB  - Deep learning based fall detection is one of the crucial tasks for intelligent video surveillance systems, which aims to detect unintentional falls of humans and alarm dangerous situations. In this work, we propose a simple and efficient framework to detect falls through a single and small-sized convolutional neural network. To this end, we first introduce a new image synthesis method that represents human motion in a single frame. This simplifies the fall detection task as an image classification task. Besides, the proposed synthetic data generation method enables to generate a sufficient amount of training dataset, resulting in satisfactory performance even with the small model. At the inference step, we also represent real human motion in a single image by estimating mean of input frames. In the experiment, we conduct both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on URFD and AIHub airport datasets to show the effectiveness of our method.

AB  - Complex inner-city junctions are among the most critical traffic areas for injury and fatal accidents. The development of highly automated driving (HAD) systems struggles with the complex and hectic everyday life within those areas. Sensor-equipped smart infrastructures, which can communicate and cooperate with vehicles, are essential to enable a holistic scene understanding to resolve occlusions drivers and vehicle perception systems for themselves can not cover. We introduce an intelligent research infrastructure equipped with visual sensor technology, located at a public inner-city junction in Aschaffenburg, Germany. A multiple-view camera system monitors the traffic situation to perceive road users' behavior. Both motorized and non-motorized traffic is considered. The system is used for research in data generation, evaluating new HAD sensors systems, algorithms, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) training strategies using real-, synthetic- and augmented data. In addition, the junction features a highly accurate digital twin. Real-world data can be taken into the digital twin for simulation purposes and synthetic data generation.

AB  - Personally identifiable information (PII) continues to be used in predictive modeling by academic researchers and industry organizations. Most notably, the healthcare industry has been a popular testbed for innovative approaches from academia and institutions to address research using PII in predictive applications and synthetic data generation. The majority of these approaches that generate synthetic PII are based on actual data or obfuscating real data parts. Privacy leakage and ethical disclosure results continue to be among the largest issues that are difficult to avoid in synthetic PII generation techniques. In this analysis, we propose a novel method to generate synthetic, differential privacy data while avoiding the common pitfalls and capable of being leveraged broadly. Evidence is also shown that proves how our novel approach can maintain inference for modeling and potential risks tied to PII features. We conclude with a summarization of our findings and results and a short discussion on how using PII data may impact organizations interested in developing predictive applications.

AB  - The objective of this contribution is to introduce setforge, a set of software tools for synthetic data generation for convolutional neural network (CNN) training. Our focus is on CNNs for 6-degree-of-freedom pose estimation using RGB-D data. To determine the pose of physical objects in 6-degree-of-freedom is an essential task for many augmented reality applications. The recent years have shown the advent of trainable methods such as CNNs and others. However, those approaches require training data. The tools, this paper introduces, allow one to generate training data from 3D models. They come with plenty of features for random data generation and augmentation, adapting colors, hue, and noise. We contribute these tools as open-source software available on Github. A prototype CNN demonstrates how one can utilize it. An augmented reality demo application also shows its real-time pose estimation performance.

AB  - Systems that analyse faces have seen significant improvements in recent years and are today used in numerous application scenarios. However, these systems have been found to be negatively affected by facial alterations such as tattoos. To better understand and mitigate the effect of facial tattoos in facial analysis systems, large datasets of images of individuals with and without tattoos are needed. To this end, we propose a generator for automatically adding realistic tattoos to facial images. Moreover, we demonstrate the feasibility of the generation by using a deep learning-based model for removing tattoos from face images. The experimental results show that it is possible to remove facial tattoos from real images without degrading the quality of the image. Additionally, we show that it is possible to improve face recognition accuracy by using the proposed deep learning-based tattoo removal before extracting and comparing facial features.

AB  - High-fidelity digital human modeling has become crucial in various applications, including gaming, visual effects and virtual reality. Despite the significant impact of eyelashes on facial aesthetics, their reconstruction and modeling have been largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce the first data-driven generative model of eyelashes based on semantic features. This model is derived from real data by introducing a new 3D eyelash reconstruction method based on multi-view images. The reconstructed data is made available which constitutes the first dataset of 3D eyelashes ever published. Through an innovative extraction process, we determine the features of any set of eyelashes, and present detailed descriptive statistics of human eyelashes shapes. The proposed eyelashes model, which exclusively relies on semantic parameters, effectively captures the appearance of a set of eyelashes. Results show that the proposed model enables interactive, intuitive and realistic eyelashes modeling for non-experts, enriching avatar creation and synthetic data generation pipelines.

AB  - For aquatic studies, radiative transfer (RT) modeling can be used to compute hyperspectral above-surface remote sensing reflectance that can be utilized for inverse model development. Inverse models can provide bathymetry and inherent and bottom-optical property estimation. Because measured oceanic field/organic datasets are often spatio-temporally sparse, synthetic data generation is useful in yielding sufficiently large datasets for inversion model development; however, these forward-modeled data are computationally expensive and time-consuming to generate. This study establishes the magnitude of wall-clock-time savings achieved for performing large, aquatic RT batch-runs using parallel computing versus a sequential approach. Given 2,600 simulations and identical compute-node characteristics, sequential architecture required similar to 100 hours until termination, whereas a parallel approach required only similar to 2.5 hours (42 compute nodes)-a 40x speed-up. Tools developed for this parallel execution are discussed.

KW  - Intrusion detection system

AB  - We have witnessed the proliferation of machine learning and its applications, especially in network-based intrusion detection systems (NIDS). With the ability to learn complex informative systems from data, machine learning models play a crucial role in identifying and preventing network attacks. However, training these models requires a massive volume of labeled data, which is nontrivial to obtain. Moreover, public datasets are often unbalanced, outdated, and different with network traffic from the networks that need to be protected. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a framework, namely DGIDS, for generating semi-synthetic datasets for NIDS, which combines synthetic data and regular network traffic collected from the local network. Our proposed framework is capable of producing both benign and attack network data with characteristics similar to those in real scenarios. In practical experiments, we show that the network data generated by DGIDS significantly increase the detection quality of NIDS trained by public datasets from 54% to 90.39%.

AB  - This paper is concerned with the robustness of parameter identification methods with respect to the noise levels typically found in experiments. More precisely, we fetus on the case of an extended nonlinear system: a system of coupled local maps akin to a discretized complex Ginzburg-Landau equation, modeling a wake experiment. After a brief description of this hydrodynamic experiment as well as of the associated cost function and synthetic data generation, we introduce two inversion methods: a one-time-step approach, and a more sophisticated n-time-step optimization procedure, solved by a backpropagation method. The one-time-step approach reduces to a small linear system for the unknown parameters, while the n-time-step approach involves a backpropagation equation for a set of Lagrange multipliers. The sensitivity of each method with respect to noise is then discussed. while the n-time-step method is very robust even with large amounts of noise, the one-time-step approach is shown to be affected by small noise levels.

CP  - German Conference on Medical Image Computing
AB  - The development of well-performing deep learning-based algorithms for thoracic abnormality detection and classification relies on access to large-scale chest X-ray datasets. However, the presence of patient-specific biometric information in chest radiographs impedes direct and public sharing of such data for research purposes due to the potential risk of patient re-identification. In this context, synthetic data generation emerges as a solution for anonymizing medical images. In this study, we utilize a privacy-enhancing sampling strategy within a latent diffusion model to generate fully anonymous chest radiographs. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the employed method and examine the impact of different privacy degrees. For each configuration, the resulting synthetic images exhibit a substantial level of data utility, with only a marginal gap compared to real data. Qualitatively, a Turing test conducted with six radiologists confirms the high and realistic appearance of the generated chest radiographs, achieving an average classification accuracy of 55% across 50 images (25 real, 25 synthetic).

AB  - The data in this article include 10,0 0 0 synthetic patients with liver disorders, characterized by 70 different variables, in-cluding clinical features, and patient outcomes, such as hos-pital admission or surgery. Patient data are generated, sim-ulating as close as possible real patient data, using a pub-licly available Bayesian network describing a casual model for liver disorders. By varying the network parameters, we also generated an additional set of 500 patients with character-istics that deviated from the initial patient population. We provide an overview of the synthetic data generation process and the associated scripts for generating the cohorts. This dataset can be useful for the machine learning models train-ing and validation, especially under the effect of dataset shift between training and testing sets.(c) 2023 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This work develops machine learning (ML) predictive models on price signals for financial instruments and their integration into trading strategies. In general, ML models have been shown powerful when trained with large amounts of data. In practice, the time-series nature of financial datasets limits the effective amount of data available to train, validate and retrain models since special care must be taken not to include future data in any way. In this setting, we develop deep generative models to produce synthetic time-series data, enhancing the amount of data available for training predictive models. Synthetic data obtained this way replicates the distribution properties of real historical data, leads to better performance, and enables thorough validation of predictive models for price signals. We leverage machine-generated predictive signals on synthetic data to build trading strategies. We show consistent improvement leading up to profits in our simulations for commodities and forex exchange markets.

AB  - Diagnosis and prognosis are key issues in the application of condition based maintenance. Thus, there is a need to evaluate the condition of a machine. Physics-based models are of great interest as they give the response of a modelled system in different operating conditions. This strategy allows for the generation of synthetic data that can be used in combination with real data acquired by sensors to improve maintenance. The article presents an electromechanical model for a rotating machine, with special emphasis on the modelling of rolling element bearings. The proposed model is validated by comparing the simulation results and the experimental results in different operating conditions and different damaged states. This comparison shows good agreement, obtaining differences of up to 10% for the modelling of the whole rotating machine and less than 0.6% for the model of the bearing.

AB  - Digitizing existing structures is essential for applying digital methods in architecture, engineering, and construction. However, the adoption of data-driven techniques for transforming point cloud data into useful digital models faces challenges, particularly in the industrial domain, where ground truth datasets for training are scarce. This paper investigates a solution leveraging synthetic data to train data-driven models effectively. In the investigated industrial domain, the complex geometry of building elements often leads to occlusions, limiting the effectiveness of conventional sampling-based synthetic data generation methods. Our approach proposes the automatic generation of realistic and semantically enriched ground truth data using surface-based sampling methods and laser scan simulation on industry-standard 3D models. In the presented experiments, we use a neural network for point cloud semantic segmentation to demonstrate that compared to sampling-based alternatives, simulation-based synthetic data significantly improve mean class intersection over union performance on real point cloud data, achieving up to 7% absolute increase.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) applications are widely prevalent in the age of Industry 4.0. These applications generate vast amounts of data that need to be processed efficiently. In some of these applications, there may be privacy concerns associated with the generated data being used to train Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. Thus, solutions are needed that can address such problems. This paper develops a methodology to generate diversified synthetic datapoints for IoT datasets, using adversarial machine learning in a game-theoretic setting. The proposed method jointly optimizes two 2-player games being played simultaneously, where the players in each 2-player game have a competing objective. The experimental results on a publicly-available dataset demonstrate that when Machine Learning (ML) models are retrained using only these synthetic datapoints, they perform better than the ML models trained on the original smart meter data, thus alleviating the need for using private data for training ML models.

AB  - The development of algorithms, based on machine learning techniques, supporting (or even replacing) human judgment must take into account concepts such as data bias and fairness. Though scientific literature proposes numerous techniques to detect and evaluate these problems, less attention has been dedicated to methods generating intentionally biased datasets, which could be used by data scientists to develop and validate unbiased and fair decision-making algorithms. To this end, this paper presents a novel method to generate a synthetic dataset, where bias can be modeled by using a probabilistic network exploiting structural equation modeling. The proposed methodology has been validated on a simple dataset to highlight the impact of tuning parameters on bias and fairness, as well as on a more realistic example based on a loan approval status dataset. In particular, this methodology requires a limited number of parameters compared to other techniques for generating datasets with a controlled amount of bias and fairness.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND STATISTICS, VOL 108

AB  - Programming by example is the problem of synthesizing a program from a small set of input / output pairs. Recent works applying machine learning methods to this task show promise, but are typically reliant on generating synthetic examples for training. A particular challenge lies in generating meaningful sets of inputs and outputs, which well-characterize a given program and accurately demonstrate its behavior. Where examples used for testing are generated by the same method as training data then the performance of a model may be partly reliant on this similarity. In this paper we introduce a novel approach using an SMT solver to synthesize inputs which cover a diverse set of behaviors for a given program. We carry out a case study comparing this method to existing synthetic data generation procedures in the literature, and find that data generated using our approach improves both the discriminatory power of example sets and the ability of trained machine learning models to generalize to unfamiliar data.

KW  - DISCLOSURE
AB  - In this paper, we propose the first formal privacy analysis of a data anonymization process known as the synthetic data generation, a technique becoming popular in the statistics community. The target application for this work is a mapping program that shows the commuting patterns of the population of the United States. The source data for this application were collected by the U.S. Census Bureau, but due to privacy constraints, they cannot be used directly by the mapping program. Instead, we generate synthetic data that statistically mimic the original data while providing privacy guarantees. We use these synthetic data as a surrogate for the original data.
   We find that while some existing definitions of privacy are inapplicable to our target application, others are too conservative and render the synthetic data useless since they guard against privacy breaches that are very unlikely. Moreover, the data in our target application is sparse, and none of the existing solutions are tailored to anonymize sparse data. In this paper, we propose solutions to address the above issues.

AB  - Since settings of conventional underfrequency load shedding (UFLS) schemes cannot be adjusted in real-time, this paper proposes a novel robust optimal design method of the UFLS scheme for an island power system (IPS) that once fixed, gives an adequate performance in all possible operating conditions in the IPS. The core of the novel robust optimal design method is the implementation of a synthetic data generation algorithm that covers all the feasible generator operating points, which are further classified into a set of large number (but computationally manageable) representative generation dispatches using clustering techniques. A real -world Spanish island will be used to illustrate the method, where the UFLS robust design will be tested and compared with non -robust UFLS designs tuned using generation dispatches of an actual day of operation provided by both standard and frequency -constrained unit commitment algorithms. Results will show that the proposed robust design avoids frequency constraints violations in contingencies and obtains better frequency metrics.

AB  - Human-object interaction detection (HOI) aims to visually deduce how people interact with surrounding objects. Although there is significant progress in advancing classification models for HOI, data remains a key problem limiting the application of HOI for real-world problems, which in turn results in insufficient applied research in HOI. In this position paper, we hence present a research agenda to aid the creation of this system - a data-centric HOI-based digital home assistant framework. The eventual goal of this digital home assistant is to understand how to apply HOI to enhance daily living experiences for the elderly. The research will embark in two phases - (1) create varied relevant HOI datasets through a novel synthetic data generator, and (2) iteratively develop the digital assistant software artifact using a system-based, user-focused design approach.

AB  - This paper focuses on probabilistic analysis of hybrid energy systems (HES), which integrate multiple energy inputs and multiple energy outputs for effective management of variability in renewable energy and grid demand. To characterize the volatility, a statistical model combining Fourier series and autoregressive moving average (ARMA) is used to generate synthetic weather condition (e.g., wind speed) and grid demand data. Specifically, Fourier series is used to model the seasonal trends in historical data, while ARMA is applied to characterize the autocorrelation in residue time series (e.g., measurements with seasonal trends subtracted). The synthetic data is shown to have same statistic characteristics with historical measurements, but possesses different temporal profile. The probabilistic analysis of a particular HES configuration is then performed, which consists of nuclear power plant, wind farm, battery storage, and desalination plant. Requirements on component ramping rate, and the effects of deploying different sizes of batteries in smoothing renewable variability, are all investigated.

AB  - In imbalanced learning, most standard classification algorithms usually fail to properly represent data distribution and provide unfavorable classification performance. More specifically, the decision rule of minority class is usually weaker than majority class, leading to many misclassification of expensive minority class data. Motivated by our previous work ADASYN [1], this paper presents a novel kernel based adaptive synthetic over-sampling approach, named KernelADASYN, for imbalanced data classification problems. The idea is to construct an adaptive over-sampling distribution to generate synthetic minority class data. The adaptive over-sampling distribution is first estimated with kernel density estimation methods and is further weighted by the difficulty level for different minority class data. The classification performance of our proposed adaptive over-sampling approach is evaluated on several real-life benchmarks, specifically on medical and healthcare applications. The experimental results show the competitive classification performance for many real-life imbalanced data classification problems.

AB  - Applying machine-learning techniques for imbalanced data sets presents a significant challenge in materials science since the underrepresented characteristics of minority classes are often buried by the abundance of unrelated characteristics in majority of classes. Existing approaches to address this focus on balancing the counts of each class using oversampling or synthetic data generation techniques. However, these methods can lead to loss of valuable information or overfitting. Here, we introduce a deep learning framework to predict minority-class materials, specifically within the realm of metal-insulator transition (MIT) materials. The proposed approach, termed boosting-CGCNN, combines the crystal graph convolutional neural network (CGCNN) model with a gradient-boosting algorithm. The model effectively handled extreme class imbalances in MIT material data by sequentially building a deeper neural network. The comparative evaluations demonstrated the superior performance of the proposed model compared to other approaches. Our approach is a promising solution for handling imbalanced data sets in materials science.

TI  - Identification of binary neutron star mergers in gravitational-wave data using object-detection machine learning models
T2  - PHYSICAL REVIEW D
LA  - English
AB  - We demonstrate the application of the YOLOv5 model, a general purpose convolution-based object detection model, in the task of detecting binary neutron star coalescence events from gravitational-wave data of current generation interferometer detectors. We also present a thorough explanation of the synthetic data generation and preparation tasks based on approximant waveform models used for the model training, validation and testing steps. Using this approach, we achieve mean average precision [0.50] values of 0.945 for a single class validation dataset and as high as 0.978 for test datasets. Moreover, the trained model is successful in identifying the GW170817 event in the LIGO H1 detector data. The identification of this event is also possible for the LIGO L1 detector data with an additional preprocessing step, without the need of removing the large glitch in the final stages of the inspiral. The detection of the GW190425 event is less successful, which attests to performance degradation with the signal-to-noise ratio. Our study indicates that the YOLOv5 model is an interesting approach for first-stage detection alarm pipelines.

AB  - Falls from scaffolds cause the majority of accidents and fatalities at construction sites. A deep learning-based 3D reconstruction technology could provide a solution to prevent such fatalities through automated scaffold monitoring. However, when the technology was used at a large-scale construction site, there were limitations, such as the scarcity of point cloud data and the non-uniformity of points. To address this issue, this paper presents a large-scale scaffold reconstruction method using synthetic scaffold datasets and an upsampling adversarial network. The method consists of four steps: 1) data acquisition of scaffold point cloud through a mobile laser scanning (MLS) system, 2) 3D semantic segmentation using synthetic datasets, 3) upsampling of the segmented scaffold points, and 4) automatic generation of a 3D CAD model. The performance of the segmentation model trained with synthetic datasets achieved an 80.83% F1 score, which improved to 94.93% after upsampling.

AB  - Electromagnetic forces, thermal loads, and radiation loads experienced by the in-vessel components or vacuum vessels at the time of the tokamak plasma current quench (CQ) significantly affect the overall plasma device's health. Thus the mitigation of plasma CQ is of paramount importance, which requires a proper identification of the disruption precursors. Using new Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches, it is possible to identify disruption precursors; however, such approaches require training the ML models. This training of models requires a massive amount of experimental data, which sometimes may not be available for different tokamaks. This necessitates the need for accurate synthetic disruption data generation presenting different types of the CQ profiles observed experimentally. A novel approach for synthetic CQ data generation, considering the experimental aspect of the CQ profile shape for a wide range of tokamak plasma discharges, is designed to train ML/AI models. The trained model results are also elaborated here, which includes identifying current before disruption and classification of CQ profile types in time-space.

AB  - Synthetic data generation is used nowadays in a number of applications with privacy issues, such as training and testing of systems for analyzing the behavior of social network users or bank customers. Very often, personal data is complex and describes different aspects of a person, some of which may be missing for some records, which makes it very hard to deal with. In this paper, we present MVAESynth, a novel framework for the data-driven generation of multimodal synthetic data. It contains our implementation of a multimodal variational auto-encoder (MVAE), which is capable of generating user multimodal personal profiles (for example, social media profiles data and transactional data) and training even with missing modalities. Extensive experimental studies of MVAESynth performance were conducted demonstrating its effectiveness compared with the available solutions for the following tasks 1) training on data with missing modalities; 2) generating realistic social network profiles; 3) restoring missing profile modalities; 4) generating profiles with the specified characteristics.

AB  - Modern rendering libraries provide unprecedented realism, producing real-time photorealistic 3D graphics on commodity hardware. Visual fidelity, however, comes at the cost of increased complexity and difficulty of usage, with many rendering parameters requiring a deep understanding of the pipeline. We propose EasyPBR as an alternative rendering library that strikes a balance between ease-of-use and visual quality. EasyPBR consists of a deferred renderer that implements recent state-of-the-art approaches in physically based rendering. It offers an easy-to-use Python and C++ interface that allows high-quality images to be created in only a few lines of code or directly through a graphical user interface. The user can choose between fully controlling the rendering pipeline or letting EasyPBR automatically infer the best parameters based on the current scene composition. The EasyPBR library can help the community to more easily leverage the power of current GPUs to create realistic images. These can then be used as synthetic data for deep learning or for creating animations for academic purposes.

AB  - Accurately modelled computer-generated data can be used in place of real-world signals for the design, test and validation of signal processing techniques in situations where real data is difficult to obtain. Bio-signal processing researchers interested in working with fNIRS data are restricted due to the lack of freely available fNIRS data and by the prohibitively expensive cost of fNIRS systems. We present a simplified mathematical description and associated MATLAB implementation of model-based synthetic fNIRS data which could be used by researchers to develop fNIRS signal processing techniques. The software, which is freely available, allows users to generate fNIRS data with control over a wide range of parameters and allows for fine-tuning of the synthetic data. We demonstrate how the model can be used to generate raw fNIRS data similar to recorded fNIRS signals. Signal processing steps were then applied to both the real and synthetic data. Visual comparisons between the temporal and spectral properties of the real and synthetic data show similarity. This paper demonstrates that our model for generating synthetic fNIRS data can replicate real fNIRS recordings.

AB  - The sharing of microdata, such as fund holdings and derivative instruments, by regulatory institutions presents a unique challenge due to strict data confidentiality and privacy regulations. These challenges often hinder the ability of both academics and practitioners to conduct collaborative research effectively. The emergence of generative models, particularly diffusion models, capable of synthesizing data mimicking the underlying distributions of real-world data presents a compelling solution. This work introduces Financial Tabular Diffusion (FinDiff), a diffusion model designed to generate real-world mixed-type financial tabular data for a variety of downstream tasks, for example, economic scenario modeling, stress tests, and fraud detection. The model uses embedding encodings to model mixed modality financial data, comprising both categorical and numeric attributes. The performance of FinDiff in generating synthetic tabular financial data is evaluated against state-of-the-art baseline models using three real-world financial datasets (including two publicly available datasets and one proprietary dataset). Empirical results demonstrate that FinDiff excels in generating synthetic tabular financial data with high fidelity, privacy, and utility.

AB  - Digital twins, virtual representations of real-life physical objects or processes, are becoming widely used in many different industrial sectors. One of the main uses of digital twins is predictive maintenance, and these technologies are being adapted to various new applications and datatypes in many industrial processes. The aim of this study was to propose a methodology to generate synthetic vibration data using a digital twin model and a predictive maintenance workflow, consisting of preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification model training, to classify faulty and healthy vibration data for state estimation. To assess the success of the proposed workflow, the mentioned steps were applied to a publicly available vibration dataset and the synthetic data from the digital twin, using five different state-of-the-art classification algorithms. For several of the classification algorithms, the accuracy result for the classification of healthy and faulty data achieved on the public dataset reached approximately 86%, and on the synthetic data, approximately 98%. These results showed the great potential for the proposed methodology, and future work in the area.</p>

AB  - This study proposes a novel method for evaluating and comparing recommender systems using synthetic user and item data and parametric synthetic user-item response (rating) functions. The method compares recommender systems on classes of synthetic data, oppositely to how it is usually done on particular real or synthetic datasets. The usage of classes particularly allows for managing the effects of the No Free Lunch theorem for recommender systems. Furthermore, we implement the method in the form of a flexible framework (that we call SynEvaRec) for conducting comparison experiments under different scenarios of synthetic data behaviour. Our experimental study shows that SynEvaRec helps to determine scenarios (e.g. in terms of data classes) where one recommender system is more preferable than another by means of recommendation quality. Moreover, the results turn to be rather stable over several synthetic dataset instances based on the same real-world dataset indicating the robustness of our method. The datasets, the framework implementation and the results related to our study are publicly available on GitHub.

AB  - Style transfer is the process of changing the style of an image, video, audio clip or musical piece so as to match the style of a given example. Even though the task has interesting practical applications within the music industry, it has so far received little attention from the audio and music processing community. In this article, we present Groove2Groove, a one-shot style transfer method for symbolic music, focusing on the case of accompaniment styles in popular music and jazz. We propose an encoder-decoder neural network for the task, along with a synthetic data generation scheme to supply it with parallel training examples. This synthetic parallel data allows us to tackle the style transfer problem using end-to-end supervised learning, employing powerful techniques used in natural language processing. We experimentally demonstrate the performance of the model on style transfer using existing and newly proposed metrics, and also explore the possibility of style interpolation.

AB  - The need for a more energy-efficient future is now more evident than ever. Energy disagreggation (NILM) methodologies have been proposed as an effective solution for the reduction in energy consumption. However, there is a wide range of challenges that NILM faces that still have not been addressed. Herein, we propose HeartDIS, a generalizable energy disaggregation pipeline backed by an extensive set of experiments, whose aim is to tackle the performance and efficiency of NILM models with respect to the available data. Our research (i) shows that personalized machine learning models can outperform more generic models; (ii) evaluates the generalization capabilities of these models through a wide range of experiments, highlighting the fact that the combination of synthetic data, the decreased volume of real data, and fine-tuning can provide comparable results; (iii) introduces a more realistic synthetic data generation pipeline based on other state-of-the-art methods; and, finally, (iv) facilitates further research in the field by publicly sharing synthetic and real data for the energy consumption of two households and their appliances.

AB  - Nowadays large-scale identity management systems enrol more than one billion data subjects. In order to limit transaction times, biometric indexing is a suitable method to reduce the search space in biometric identifications. Effective testing of such biometric identification systems and biometric indexing approaches requires large datasets of biometric data. Currently, the size of the publicly available iris datasets is insufficient, especially for system scalability assessments. Synthetic data generation offers a potential solution to this issue; however, it is challenging to generate data that is both statistically sound and visually realistic - for the iris, the currently available approaches prove unsatisfactory.
   In this paper, we present a method for generation of synthetic binary iris-based templates, i.e. Iris-Codes, which are the de facto standard used throughout major biometric deployments around the world. We validate the statistical properties of the synthetic templates and show that they closely resemble ones produced from real ocular images. With the proposed approach, large databases of synthetic Iris-Codes with flexibly adjustable properties can be generated.

KW  - SIMBRITAIN
AB  - Simulation models are increasingly used in applied research to create synthetic micropopulations and predict possible individual-level outcomes of policy intervention. Previous research highlights the relevance of simulation techniques in estimating the potential outcomes of changes in areas such as taxation and child benefit policy, crime, education, or health inequalities. To date, however, there is very little published research on the creation, calibration, and testing of such micropopulations and models, and little on the issue of how well synthetic data can fit locally as opposed to globally in such models. This paper discusses the process of improving the process of synthetic micropopulation generation with the aim of improving and extending existing spatial microsimulation models. Experiments using different variable configurations to constrain the models are undertaken with the emphasis on producing a suite of models to match the different sociodemographic conditions found within a typical city. The results show that creating processes to generate area-specific synthetic populations, which reflect the diverse populations within the study area, provides more accurate population estimates for future policy work than the traditional global model configurations.

AB  - To examine structural safety and reliability, an accurate prediction of the variability of structural resistance must first be determined. This may be achieved through extensive physical testing or, more commonly in modern research, synthetic data generation, such as stochastic finite element analyses (SFEAs). Due to the prevalence and versatility of such techniques, and the need for a high level of confidence when performing a safety assessment, an understanding of the accuracy of data derived from SFEAs is essential. In this paper, SFEA models have been developed to predict the responses of 16 unreinforced masonry walls tested in a laboratory under cyclic in-plane lateral loading. Each SFEA has been developed to reflect the as-built conditions of these experimental specimens and focus on predicting the shear capacity of the failure mechanisms that unreinforced masonry shear walls are susceptible to. From the results of these SFEAs, the accuracy (quantified as model error) of this modelling strategy has been estimated by comparing the peak in-plane shear resistances of the laboratory and numerical models.

AB  - Three-dimensional human shape reconstruction is important in many applications, such as virtual or augmented reality (VR/AR), virtual clothing fitting, and healthcare. In this paper, we propose a learning-based method for reconstructing a whole-body point cloud from a single front-view human-depth image. Because actual depth images typically suffer from noise and missing data, an accurate point cloud cannot be reasonably obtained by simply predicting a back-view depth image. To solve this problem, we propose to use convolutional neural networks that not only predict a back-view depth image but also refine the input front-view depth image. To train the networks, we propose a carefully designed method for generating synthetic but realistic human-depth images with noise and missing data. Experiments show that the proposed method is effective for obtaining seamless whole-body point clouds. In addition, the experiments show that the networks trained on the synthetic depth images are ready for application to actual depth images.

AB  - Introduction Service robotics is recently enhancing precision agriculture enabling many automated processes based on efficient autonomous navigation solutions. However, data generation and in-field validation campaigns hinder the progress of large-scale autonomous platforms. Simulated environments and deep visual perception are spreading as successful tools to speed up the development of robust navigation with low-cost RGB-D cameras.Materials and methods In this context, the contribution of this work resides in a complete framework to fully exploit synthetic data for a robust visual control of mobile robots. A wide realistic multi-crops dataset is accurately generated to train deep semantic segmentation networks and enabling robust performance in challenging real-world conditions. An automatic parametric approach enables an easy customization of virtual field geometry and features for a fast reliable evaluation of navigation algorithms.Results and conclusion The high quality of the generated synthetic dataset is demonstrated by an extensive experimentation with real crops images and benchmarking the resulting robot navigation both in virtual and real fields with relevant metrics.

AB  - This article outlines the construction of universal, user-friendly smart robot system for manipulation in a dynamic environment through AI-based vision system which incorporates processing on the edge. To successfully perform complex tasks in changing conditions, robots require both intelligence for adaptive decision-making and the ability to accurately perceive the environment and interface with it. The proposed system is built in a way that maximizes the modularity of the system. And thus, improves the ease at which the system can be modified to other specific goals after it has been operationalized. Whereas these characteristics are achieved by the use of synthetically generated data and Robot Operating System (ROS) as a middleware software. The first results prove the feasibility of training object detection networks on synthetically generated data sets. And also a combination of a 3D camera and industrial robot provides a convenient way for adding new objects to the database.

AB  - We are witnessing the digitalization era, where artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) models are mandatory to transform this data deluge into actionable information. However, these models require large, high-quality datasets to predict high reliability/accuracy. Even with the maturity of Internet of Things (IoT) systems, there are still numerous scenarios where there is not enough quantity and quality of data to successfully develop AI/ML-based applications that can meet market expectations. One such scenario is precision agriculture, where operational data generation is costly and unreliable due to the extreme and remote conditions of numerous crops. In this paper, we investigated the generation of synthetic data as a method to improve predictions of AI/ML models in precision agriculture. We used generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate synthetic temperature data for a greenhouse located in Murcia (Spain). The results reveal that the use of synthetic data significantly improves the accuracy of the AI/ML models targeted compared to using only ground truth data.

AB  - Query-aware synthetic data generation is an essential and highly challenging task, important for database management system (DBMS) testing, database application testing and application-driven benchmarking. Prior studies on query-aware data generation suffer common problems of limited parallelization, poor scalability, and excessive memory consumption, making these systems unsatisfactory to terabyte scale data generation. In order to fill the gap between the existing data generation techniques and the emerging demands of enormous query-aware test databases, we design and implement a new data generator, called Touchstone. Touchstone adopts the random sampling algorithm instantiating query parameters and the new data generation schema generating the test database, to achieve fully parallel data generation, linear scalability and austere memory consumption. It has full support of outer joins as well as non-equi-joins for application-oriented data generation. Our experimental results show that Touchstone consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art solution on TPC-H workload by a 1000x speedup without sacrificing simulation fidelity.

TI  - GEC-DePenD: Non-Autoregressive Grammatical Error Correction with Decoupled Permutation and Decoding

AB  - Grammatical error correction (GEC) is an important NLP task that is currently usually solved with autoregressive sequence-to-sequence models. However, approaches of this class are inherently slow due to one-by-one token generation, so non-autoregressive alternatives are needed. In this work, we propose a novel non-autoregressive approach to GEC that decouples the architecture into a permutation network that outputs a self-attention weight matrix that can be used in beam search to find the best permutation of input tokens (with auxiliary hinsi tokens) and a decoder network based on a step-unrolled denoising autoencoder that fills in specific tokens. This allows us to find the token permutation after only one forward pass of the permutation network, avoiding autoregressive constructions. We show that the resulting network improves over previously known non-autoregressive methods for GEC and reaches the level of autoregressive methods that do not use language-specific synthetic data generation methods. Our results are supported by a comprehensive experimental validation on the ConLL-2014 and Write&Improve+LOCNESS datasets and an extensive ablation study that supports our architectural and algorithmic choices.

AB  - Background: Positron Emission Tomography - Computed Tomography (PET/CT) imaging is the basis for the evaluation of response-to-treatment of several oncological diseases. In practice, such evaluation is manually performed by specialists, which is rather complex and time-consuming. Evaluation measures have been proposed, but with questionable reliability. The usage of before and after-treatment image descriptors of the lesions for treatment response evaluation is still a territory to be explored.
   Methods: In this project, Artificial Neural Network approaches were implemented to automatically assess treatment response of patients suffering from neuroendocrine tumors and Hodgkyn lymphoma, based on image features extracted from PET/CT.
   Results: The results show that the considered set of features allows for the achievement of very high classification performances, especially when data is properly balanced.
   Conclusions: After synthetic data generation and PCA-based dimensionality reduction to only two components, LVQNN assured classification accuracies of 100%, 100%, 96.3% and 100% regarding the 4 response- to-treatment classes.

AB  - Statistical tomography to obtain local field variables from non-intrusive line-of-sight measurements in turbulent flows has been an intriguing subject for some time. In this study, a novel algorithm is presented to obtain statistical information on the local scalar field in axisymmetric turbulent flows. The algorithm uses line-of-sight transverse deflection angle measurements in only one view direction to greatly simplify the optical configuration. The validity of the algorithm is examined using noise-free synthetically generated scalar data that simulate the concentration field of a turbulent helium jet. Results show that the proposed algorithm provides excellent reconstruction of integral length scale and variance of refractive index difference, which can be related to scalar physical properties such as density, temperature and/or species concentrations. Good reconstruction accuracy and the need for a simple optical configuration make the proposed algorithm a promising method to characterize the scalar field in turbulent flows using path-integrated measurements.

AB  - Recent years have seen deep learning (DL) architectures being leveraged for learning the nonlinear relationships across the parameters in seismic inversion problems in order to better analyse the subsurface, such as improved velocity model building (VMB). In this study, we focus on deep-learning-based inversion (DLI) for velocity model building, leveraging on a conditional generative adversarial network (PIX2PIX) with ResNet-9 as generator, as well as a comprehensive mathematical methodology for generating samples of multi-stratified heterogeneous velocity models for training the DLI architecture. We demonstrate that the proposed architecture can achieve state-of-the-art performance in reconstructing velocity models using only one seismic shot, thus reducing cost and computational complexity. We also demonstrate that the proposed solution is generalisable across linear multi-layer models, curved or folded structures, structures with salt bodies as well as higher-resolution structures built from geological images through quantitative and qualitative evaluation.

AB  - Early interpretation of skin cancer through computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tools reduced the intricacy of the treatments as it can attain a 95% recovery rate. To frame up with computer-aided diagnosis system, scientists adopted various artificial intelligence (AI) designed to receive the best classifiers among these diverse features. This investigation covers traditional color-based texture, shape, and statistical features of melanoma skin lesion and contrasted with suggested methods and approaches. The quantized color feature set of 4992 traits were pre-processed before training the model. The experimental images have combined images of naevus (1500), melanoma (1000), and basal cell carcinoma (500). The proposed methods handled issues like class imbalanced with generative adversarial networks (GAN). The recommended color quantization method with synthetic data generation increased the accuracy of the popular machine learning models as it gives an accuracy of 97.08% in random forest. The proposed model preserves a decent accuracy with KNN, adaboost, and gradient boosting.

AB  - Sediment accumulation in a river reservoir is studied by stochastic time series models and analytical approach. The first-order moving average process is found the best for the suspended sediment discharge time series of the Juniata River at Newport, Pennsylvania, USA. Synthetic suspended sediment discharges are first generated with the chosen model after which analytical expressions are derived for the expected value and variance of sediment accumulation in the reservoir. The expected value and variance of the volume of sediment accumulation in the reservoir are calculated from a thousand synthetic time series each 38 years long and compared to the analytical approach. Stochastic and analytical approaches perfectly trace the observation in terms of the expected value and variability. Therefore, it is concluded that the expected value and variance of sediment accumulation in a reservoir could be estimated by analytical expressions without the cost of synthetic data generation mechanisms.

CP  - IEEE Applied Imagery Pattern Recognition Workshop (AIPR)
AB  - The low/no-shot problem refers to a lack of available data for training deep learning algorithms. In remote sensing, complete image data sets are rare and do not always include the targets of interest. We propose a method to rapidly generate high-fidelity synthetic satellite imagery featuring targets of interest over a range of solar illuminations and platform geometries. Specifically, we used the Digital Imaging and Remote Sensing Image Generation model and a custom image simulator to produce synthetic imagery of C130 aircraft in place of real Worldview-3 imagery. Our synthetic imagery was supplemented with real Worldview-3 images to test the efficacy of training deep learning algorithms with synthetic data. We deliberately chose a challenging test case of distinguishing C130s from other aircraft, or neither. Results show a negligible improvement in automatic target classification when synthetic data is supplemented with a small amount of real imagery. However, training with synthetic data alone only achieves F1-scores in line with a random classifier, suggesting that there is still significant domain mismatch between the real and synthetic datasets.

AB  - The absence of large scale datasets with pixel-level supervisions is a significant obstacle for the training of deep convolutional networks for scene text segmentation. For this reason, synthetic data generation is normally employed to enlarge the training dataset. Nonetheless, synthetic data cannot reproduce the complexity and variability of natural images. In this paper, a weakly supervised learning approach is used to reduce the shift between training on real and synthetic data. Pixel-level supervisions for a text detection dataset (i.e. where only bounding-box annotations are available) are generated. In particular, the COCO-Text-Segmentation (COCO_TS) dataset, which provides pixel-level supervisions for the COCO-Text dataset, is created and released. The generated annotations are used to train a deep convolutional neural network for semantic segmentation. Experiments show that the proposed dataset can be used instead of synthetic data, allowing us to use only a fraction of the training samples and significantly improving the performances.

AB  - Transportation electrification and connected automated vehicle infrastructures are the future of sustainable e-mobility, fueling the robust deployment of vehicle charging infrastructures and evolving network and communication architectures. The incumbent technologies of sustainable e-mobility migrate the inherent vulnerabilities in software, hardware, protocols, communication, and human that state-funded or ill-willed cyber attackers could exploit. The existing deep learning-based detection algorithms suffer from constrained performance due to insufficient cyberattack data. Inspired by the synthetic data generation by the generative adversarial network (GAN), we propose the external classifier Wasserstein condition GAN (EC-WCGAN)-based network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) to detect the distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks in the EV Charging infrastructures. Moreover, it can inform the different DDoS attack classes as well. The proposed method surpasses the DL-based model in terms of data usage and performance metrics. This method enhances the detection by generating plausible synthetic data for the low sample classes and training the classifier to get more than 99% performance metrics.

AB  - Synthetic data is emerging as a promising solution to the scalability issue of supervised deep learning, especially when real data are difficult to acquire or hard to annotate. Synthetic data generation, however, can itself be prohibitively expensive when domain experts have to manually and painstakingly oversee the process. Moreover, neural networks trained on synthetic data often do not perform well on real data because of the domain gap. To solve these challenges, we propose Sim2SG, a self-supervised automatic scene generation technique for matching the distribution of real data. Importantly, Sim2SG does not require supervision from the real-world dataset, thus making it applicable in situations for which such annotations are difficult to obtain. Sim2SG is designed to bridge both the content and appearance gaps, by matching the content of real data, and by matching the features in the source and target domains. We select scene graph (SG) generation as the downstream task, due to the limited availability of labeled datasets. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements over leading baselines in reducing the domain gap both qualitatively and quantitatively, on several synthetic datasets as well as the real-world KITTI dataset.

CP  - 10th Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining
AB  - The growth of Internet commerce has provoked the use of Recommender Systems (RS). Adequate datasets of users and products have always been demanding to better evaluate RS algorithms. Yet, the amount of public data, especially data containing content information (attributes) is limited. In addition, the performance of RS is highly dependent on various characteristics of the datasets. Thus, few others have conducted studies on synthetically generated datasets to mimic the user-product relationship. Evaluating algorithms based on only one or two datasets is often not sufficient. A more thorough analysis can be conducted by applying systematic changes to data, which cannot be done with real data. However, synthetic datasets that include attributes are rarely investigated. In this paper, we review synthetic datasets applied in RS and present our synthetic data generation methodology that considers attributes. Furthermore, we conduct empirical evaluations on existing hybrid recommendation algorithms and other state-of-the-art algorithms using these variable synthetic data and observe their behavior as the characteristic of data varies. In addition, we also introduce the use of entropy to control the randomness of the generated data.

TI  - Synthetic Data Generation Framework, Dataset, and Efficient Deep Model for Pedestrian Intention Prediction
T2  - 2023 IEEE 26TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS, ITSC
LA  - English
CP  - IEEE 26th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)
AB  - Pedestrian intention prediction is crucial for autonomous driving. In particular, knowing if pedestrians are going to cross in front of the ego-vehicle is core to performing safe and comfortable maneuvers. Creating accurate and fast models that predict such intentions from sequential images is challenging. A factor contributing to this is the lack of datasets with diverse crossing and non-crossing (C/NC) scenarios. We address this scarceness by introducing a framework, named ARCANE, which allows programmatically generating synthetic datasets consisting of C/NC video clip samples. As an example, we use ARCANE to generate a large and diverse dataset named PedSynth. We will show how PedSynth complements widely used real-world datasets such as JAAD and PIE, so enabling more accurate models for C/NC prediction. Considering the onboard deployment of C/NC prediction models, we also propose a deep model named PedGNN, which is fast and has a very low memory footprint. PedGNN is based on a GNN-GRU architecture that takes a sequence of pedestrian skeletons as input to predict crossing intentions. ARCANE, PedSynth, and PedGNN is publicly released(1).

AB  - Empirical studies in agricultural economics usually involve policy implications. In many cases, such studies rely on proprietary or confidential data that cannot be published along with the article, challenging the replicability and credibility of the results. To overcome this problem, the use of synthetic data-that is, data that do not contain a single unit of the original data-has been proposed. In this note, we illustrate the utility of synthetic data generation methods for replication purposes using a range of methods from agricultural production analysis. More specifically, we compare input elasticities and technical efficiency scores based on different farm-level production data between original data and synthetic data. We generate synthetic data using a non-parametric method of classification and regression trees (CART) and parametric linear regressions. We find synthetic data result in elasticities and technical efficiency distributions that are very similar to the original data, especially when generated with CART, and conclude with implications for the research community.

AB  - Load modeling is one of the crucial tasks for improving smart grids' energy efficiency. Among many alternatives, machine learning-based load models have become popular in applications and have shown outstanding performance in recent years. The performance of these models highly relies on data quality and quantity available for training. However, gathering a sufficient amount of high-quality data is time-consuming and extremely expensive. In the last decade, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have demonstrated their potential to solve the data shortage problem by generating synthetic data by learning from recorded/empirical data. Educated synthetic datasets can reduce prediction error of electricity consumption when combined with empirical data. Further, they can be used to enhance risk management calculations. Therefore, we propose RCGAN, TimeGAN, CWGAN, and RCWGAN which take individual electricity consumption data as input to provide synthetic data in this study. Our work focuses on one dimensional times series, and numerical experiments on an empirical dataset show that GANs are indeed able to generate synthetic data with realistic appearance.

AB  - Imbalanced class distributions are common in real-world scenarios, including datasets with multiple labels. One widely acknowledged approach to addressing imbalanced distributions is through oversampling, a technique that both balances the class distribution and improves the effectiveness of classification models. However, when generating synthetic data for multi-label datasets, complexities arise due to the presence of multiple-label sets, which require careful placement and labeling. We propose MLCSMOTE-FRST, an algorithm for synthetic data generation based on label-specific clustering and fuzzy rough set theory. Generation ratios and dependency samples are provided by clusters specific to each label, with a focus on the overall label distribution and the distribution within each cluster. The labels are supported by intra-cluster positive samples, determined using fuzzy rough set theory, which helps to capture the consensus label set. Experimental results on multi-label datasets using four classifiers demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of macro-F1 and micro-F1 scores.

AB  - Copulas are quite a popular, flexible, and useful tool for multivariate modeling in many fields of applications, including finance and insurance, actuarial sciences, biomedical studies, geostatistics, and hydrology. In this paper, we use the concept of diagonal function to build new bivariate copulas based on the well known and important Ali-Mikhail-Haq (AMH), Farlie-Gumbel-Morgenstern (FGM) and Plackett families. We also study some dependence properties of the newly constructed semilinear copulas, namely, the Spearman's rho coefficient. In particular, we find that the range of this rank correlation coefficient varies between weak and moderate values for the transformed AMH and FGM families, although it varies between moderate and strong values for the transformed Plackett families. Moreover, in all cases, the Spearman's rho coefficient reaches negative and positive values. Finally, we present a synthetic data generation algorithm, as well as a classical method of estimation of the copula association parameter theta for each of the six transformed bivariate families.

AB  - Machine learning-guided optical proximity correction, called ML-OPC in this paper, has recently been proposed to alleviate long runtime of model-based OPC. ML-OPC using regression methods has been presented but with limited prediction accuracy. We propose neural network classifier-based OPC (NNC-OPC), in which a neural network classifier serves as a mask bias model. A few techniques are applied to enhance basic NNC-OPC: parameterization of layout segments using polar Fourier transform signals, dimensionality reduction through weighted principal component analysis, and sampling of training layout segments. Training segments are typically imbalanced over the range of mask biases, which may cause large prediction error for segments that appear less frequently. This is resolved by three techniques: 1) synthetic data generation; 2) class reorganization; and 3) an adaptive learning rate. Experiments with NNC-OPC with all techniques applied indicate that prediction error of mask bias and training time are reduced by 29% and 80%, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art ML-OPC with regression methods.

AB  - The malicious insider threat is often listed as one of the most dangerous cloud threats. Considering this threat, the main difference between a cloud computing scenario and a traditional IT infrastructure, is that once perpetrated, it could damage other clients due to the multi-tenancy and virtual environment cloud features. One of the related challenges concerns the fact that this threat domain is highly dependent on human behavior characteristics as opposed to the more purely technical domains of network data generation. In this paper, we focus on the derivation and validation of the dataset for cloud-based malicious insider threat. Accordingly, we outline the design of synthetic data, while discussing cloud-based indicators, and socio-technical human factors. As a proof of concept. we test our model on an airline scheduling application provided by a flight operator, together with proposing realistic threat scenarios for its future detection. The work is motivated by the complexity of the problem itself as well as by the absence of the open. realistic cloud-based datasets.

AB  - This work introduces a framework to address the computational complexity inherent in Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) models by harnessing the potential of deep learning. By employing deep learning, we construct problem-specific heuristics that identify and exploit common structures across MIP instances. We train deep learning models to estimate complicating binary variables for target MIP problem instances. The resulting reduced MIP models are solved using standard off-the-shelf solvers. We present an algorithm for generating synthetic data enhancing the robustness and generalizability of our models across diverse MIP instances. We compare the effectiveness of (a) feed-forward neural networks (ANN) and (b) convolutional neural networks (CNN). To enhance the framework's performance, we employ Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning, aiming to maximize the occurrence of global optimum solutions. We apply this framework to a flow-based facility location allocation MIP formulation that describes long-term investment planning and medium-term tactical scheduling in a personalized medicine supply chain.

TI  - 3D GAN image synthesis and dataset quality assessment for bacterial biofilm
T2  - BIOINFORMATICS
LA  - English
KW  - TRACKING
AB  - Motivation: Data-driven deep learning techniques usually require a large quantity of labeled training data to achieve reliable solutions in bioimage analysis. However, noisy image conditions and high cell density in bacterial biofilm images make 3D cell annotations difficult to obtain. Alternatively, data augmentation via synthetic data generation is attempted, but current methods fail to produce realistic images.
   Results: This article presents a bioimage synthesis and assessment workflow with application to augment bacterial biofilm images. 3D cyclic generative adversarial networks (GAN) with unbalanced cycle consistency loss functions are exploited in order to synthesize 3D biofilm images from binary cell labels. Then, a stochastic synthetic dataset quality assessment (SSQA) measure that compares statistical appearance similarity between random patches from random images in two datasets is proposed. Both SSQA scores and other existing image quality measures indicate that the proposed 3D Cyclic GAN, along with the unbalanced loss function, provides a reliably realistic (as measured by mean opinion score) 3D synthetic biofilm image. In 3D cell segmentation experiments, a GAN-augmented training model also presents more realistic signal-to-background intensity ratio and improved cell counting accuracy.

AB  - We present SfM Flow, a Blender add-on that provides a toolset for the evaluation of three-dimensional reconstructions obtained form images. 3D reconstruction is increasingly becoming popular and, to date, many techniques are available to perform it. Choosing which technology to use for a specific 3D reconstruction task can be resource and time-consuming. By using this tool it is possible to create images of a virtual 3D scene, perform 3D reconstructions starting from the generated images using Structure from Motion pipelines, and evaluate the accuracy of the obtained 3D reconstruction. The evaluation is carried out comparing the 3D reconstruction with the virtual scene's geometry, that constitutes an exact ground truth, without the need for complex setup and dedicated hardware for the acquisition of a real scene. Furthermore, SfM Flow includes support for different lighting, depth of field, and motion blur setups, thus allowing to stress the 3D reconstruction pipelines under common critical conditions.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to extend the capabilities of multispectral optical imaging techniques for morphological characterization of irregular particles, encountered in several applications. We have utilized the Gaussian random ellipsoid model to quantize the shape elongation and deviation in complex-shaped particles. Compared with the Gaussian random sphere model, it is more realistic and is applicable to wider range of irregular particles with minimum possible of free parameters. By processing the reduced light scattering spectra, the proposed inverse technique can simultaneously recover the size, volume fraction, elongation, and shape deformation of particles that are randomly oriented within a colloidal suspension. The discrete dipole approximation is employed in forward light scattering calculations, and input synthetic data generation. To investigate the robustness of our algorithm in coping with real scenarios, we have added different levels of noise to the observed scattering spectra. The results demonstrate the potential of our technique to non-invasively recover the morphology parameters of irregular particles. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, such tools require large volumes of high-quality training data, which can be challenging to obtain. This paper combines the experience of an AI startup with an analysis of the FAIR principles of the eight available datasets. It demonstrates that the datasets vary considerably, particularly in their interoperability, as each dataset is skewed towards a particular clinical use-case. Additionally, the mix of digital captures and scanned film compounds the problem of variability, along with differences in licensing terms, ease of access, labelling reliability, and file formats. Improving interoperability through adherence to standards such as the BIRADS criteria for labelling and annotation, and a consistent file format, could markedly improve access and use of larger amounts of standardized data. This, in turn, could be increased further by GAN-based synthetic data generation, paving the way towards better health outcomes for breast cancer.

AB  - Realistic, scalable, and controllable generation of furniture layouts is essential for many applications in virtual reality, augmented reality, game development and synthetic data generation. The most successful current methods tackle this problem as a sequence generation problem which imposes a specific ordering on the elements of the layout, making it hard to exert fine-grained control over the attributes of a generated scene. Existing methods provide control through object-level conditioning, or scene completion, where generation can be conditioned on an arbitrary subset of furniture objects. However, attribute-level conditioning, where generation can be conditioned on an arbitrary subset of object attributes, is not supported. We propose COFS, a method to generate furniture layouts that enables fine-grained control through attribute-level conditioning. For example, COFS allows specifying only the scale and type of objects that should be placed in the scene and the generator chooses their positions and orientations; or the position that should be occupied by objects can be specified and the generator chooses their type, scale, orientation, etc. Our results show both qualitatively and quantitatively that we significantly outperform existing methods on attribute-level conditioning.

AB  - Generating synthetic data sets is integral to benchmarking, debugging, and simulating future scenarios. As data sets become larger, real data characteristics thereby become necessary for the success of new algorithms. Recently introduced software systems allow for synthetic data generation that is truly parallel. These systems use fast pseudorandom number generators and can handle complex schemas and uniqueness constraints on single attributes. Uniqueness is essential for forming keys, which identify single entries in a database instance. The uniqueness property is usually guaranteed by sampling from a uniform distribution and adjusting the sample size to the output size of the table such that there are no collisions. However, when it comes to real composite keys, where only the combination of the key attribute has the uniqueness property, a different strategy needs to be employed. In this paper, we present a novel approach on how to generate composite keys within a parallel data generation framework. We compute a joint probability distribution that incorporates the distributions of the key attributes and use the unique sequence positions of entries to address distinct values in the key domain.

AB  - Generation of synthetic datasets is a common practice in many research areas. Such data is often generated to meet specific needs or certain conditions that may not be easily found in the original, real data. The nature of the data varies according to the application area and includes text, graphs, social or weather data, among many others. The common process to create such synthetic datasets is to implement small scripts or programs, restricted to small problems or to a specific application. In this paper we propose a framework designed to generate high dimensional datasets. Users can interactively create and navigate through multi dimensional datasets using a suitable graphical user-interface. The data creation is driven by statistical distributions based on a few user-defined parameters. First, a grounding dataset is created according to given inputs, and then structures and trends are included in selected dimensions and orthogonal projection planes. Furthermore, our framework supports the creation of complex non-orthogonal trends and classified datasets. It can successfully be used to create synthetic datasets simulating important trends as multidimensional clusters, correlations and outliers.

AB  - Generating production-like test data that complies with privacy regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), is a significant challenge in testing data-intensive software systems. In our previous research, we posed this challenge as a language modeling problem. We trained a language model to capture the statistical properties of production data, and showed that it can effectively generate production-like test data. However, the richness of the generated data in our earlier work was limited by the information capacity of the domain-specific language that we used for representing the data and the training corpus. In this paper, we present an enhanced approach, by using a more expressive domain-specific language with a higher information capacity. We show that using the new domain specific language allowes better leveraging the deep-learning technology and generate even richer, production-like test data. Our experiment results show that with higher information capacity and constraints complexity, the new language performs better regarding generated data quality, with an affordable increase on computational cost.

AB  - We present a visual localization system that learns to estimate camera poses in the real world with the help of synthetic data. Despite significant progress in recent years, most learning-based approaches to visual localization target at a single domain and require a dense database of geo-tagged images to function well. To mitigate the data scarcity issue and improve the scalability of the neural localization models, we introduce TOPO-DataGen, a versatile synthetic data generation tool that traverses smoothly between the real and virtual world, hinged on the geographic camera viewpoint. New large-scale sim-to-real benchmark datasets are proposed to showcase and evaluate the utility of the said synthetic data. Our experiments reveal that synthetic data generically enhances the neural network performance on real data. Furthermore, we introduce CrossLoc, a cross-modal visual representation learn- ing approach to pose estimation that makes full use of the scene coordinate ground truth via self-supervision. Without any extra data, CrossLoc significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and achieves substantially higher real-data sample efficiency. Our code and datasets are all available at crossloc.githup.io.

AB  - Recent advances in computing power have seen machine teaming becoming an area of significant interest in manufacturing for scholars attempting to realise its full potential. Successful machine learning applications require a great amount of specific production data that is not easily nor publicly accessible. This study aims to develop a framework to use discrete-event-simulation (DES) to generate large datasets for training machine learning models. Three DES models were designed and executed to generate synthetic production data for different manufacturing scenarios. Inferences were made on the dependency between the time required to generate data and the complexity of the simulation model. The experimental results show that with the incremental changes in the simulation model, the time required to generate synthetic data tends to increase. The study revealed that DES is an effective tool for generating high-quality synthetic data which can be fed into machine learning models for training. The datasets generated by the simulations are made publicly available.

AB  - Over the past three decades, synthetic data methods for statistical disclosure control have continually evolved, but mainly within the domain of survey data sets. There are certain characteristics of administrative databases, such as their size, which present challenges from a synthesis perspective and require special attention. This paper, through the fitting of saturated count models, presents a synthesis method that is suitable for administrative databases. It is tuned by two parameters, sigma and alpha. The method allows large categorical data sets to be synthesized quickly and allows risk and utility metrics to be satisfied a priori, that is, prior to synthetic data generation. The paper explores how the flexibility afforded by two-parameter count models (the negative binomial and Poisson-inverse Gaussian) can be utilised to protect respondents'-especially uniques'-privacy in synthetic data. Finally, an empirical example is carried out through the synthesis of a database which can be viewed as a good substitute to the English School Census.

AB  - Machine learning approaches like deep neural networks have proven to be very successful in many domains However, they require training on a huge volumes of data. While these approaches work very well in a few selected domains where a large corpus of training data exists, they shift the bottleneck in development of machine learning applications to the data acquisition phase and are difficult to use in domains where training data is hard to acquire. For sensor fusion applications in coalition operations, access to good training data that will be suitable for real-life applications is hard to get. The training data sets available are limited in size. For these domains, we need to explore approaches for machine learning which can work with small amounts of data. In this paper, we will look at the current and emerging approaches which allow us to build machine learning models when access to the training data is limited. The approaches examined include statistical machine learning, transfer learning, synthetic data generation, semi-supervised learning and one-shot learning.

KW  - Differential privacy
KW  - Generative adversarial nets
AB  - In the era of big data, increasingly massive volumes of data is generated and published consecutively for both research and commercial purposes. The potential value of sensitive information also attracts interest from adversaries and thereby arises public concern. Current research mostly focuses on privacy-preserving data publishing in a statistic manner rather than taking the dynamics and correlation of context into consideration. Motivated by this, we propose a novel idea that combining differential privacy and generative adversarial nets. Generative adversarial nets and its extensions are used to generate a synthetic dataset with indistinguishable statistic features while differential privacy guarantees a trade-off between privacy protection and data utility. By employing a min-max game with three players, we devise a deep generative model, namely DP-GAN model, for synthetic data generation while fulfilling the privacy constraints in a differentially private manner. Extensive simulation results on a real-world dataset testify the superiority of the proposed model in terms of privacy protection, data utility, and efficiency.

AB  - Smart speakers, such as Alexa and Google Home, support daily activities in smart home environments. Even though voice commands enable friction-less interactions, existing financial transaction authorization mechanisms hinder usability. A non-invasive authorization by leveraging presence and light sensors' data is proposed in order to replace invasive procedure through smartphone notification. The Coloured Petri Net model was created for synthetic data generation, and one month data were collected in test bed with real users. Random Forest machine learning models were used for smart home behavior information retrieval. The LSTM prediction model was evaluated while using test bed data, and an open dataset from CASAS. The proposed authorization mechanism is based on Physical Unclonable Function usage as a random number generator seed in a Challenge Response protocol. The simulations indicate that the proposed scheme with specialized autonomous device could halve the total response time for low value financial transactions triggered by voice, from 7.3 to 3.5 s in a non-invasive manner, maintaining authorization security.

AB  - The growing interest in the study of functional brain-heart interplay (BHI) has motivated the development of novel methodological frameworks for its quantification. While a combination of electroencephalography (EEG) and heartbeat-derived series has been widely used, the role of EEG preprocessing on a BHI quantification is yet unknown. To this extent, here we investigate on four different EEG electrical referencing techniques associated with BHI quantifications over 4-minute resting-state in 15 healthy subjects. BHI methods include the synthetic data generation model, heartbeat-evoked potentials, heartbeat-evoked oscillations, and maximal information coefficient (MIC). EEG signals were offline referenced under the Cz channel, common average, mastoids average, and Laplacian method, and statistical comparisons were performed to assess similarities between references and between BHI techniques. Results show a topographical agreement between BHI estimation methods depending on the specific EEG reference. Major differences between BHI methods occur with the Laplacian reference, while major differences between EEG references are with the MIC analysis. We conclude that the choice of EEG electrical reference may significantly affect a functional BHI quantification.

AB  - The training of computer vision models for human pose estimation requires large amounts of data. Since labelling image data with pose keypoints is very time consuming and costly, we aim to alleviate this requirement by using synthetic data during pre-training and thus relax the need for large amounts of real data samples during fine-tuning. To this end, we investigate the impact of synthetic data on the performance of a 2D keypoint detection model in the context of driver body pose estimation. We present our approach for synthetic data generation to automatically provide large amounts of in-cabin views as training data. The utilization of the generated synthetic data is evaluated in different learning schemes. We achieve a notable performance gain of +30.5% by pre-training with our in-cabin synthetic data when only 1% of real training data from the DriPE dataset is available. The proposed approach also outperforms pre-training with PeopleSansPeople by +8.3% when the reduced DriPE dataset is used for fine-tuning.

AB  - Goal: To develop a computationally efficient and unbiased synthetic data generator for large-scale in silico clinical trials (CTs). Methods: We propose the BGMM-OCE, an extension of the conventional BGMM (Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Models) algorithm to provide unbiased estimations regarding the optimal number of Gaussian components and yield high-quality, large-scale synthetic data at reduced computational complexity. Spectral clustering with efficient eigenvalue decomposition is applied to estimate the hyperparameters of the generator. A case study is conducted to compare the performance of BGMM-OCE against four straightforward synthetic data generators for in silico CTs in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Results: The BGMM-OCE generated 30000 virtual patient profiles having the lowest coefficient-of-variation (0.046), inter- and intra-correlation differences (0.017, and 0.016, respectively) with the real ones in reduced execution time. Conclusions: BGMM-OCE overcomes the lack of population size in HCM which obscures the development of targeted therapies and robust risk stratification models.

AB  - This paper explores the use of state-of-the-art latent diffusion models, specifically stable diffusion, to generate synthetic images for improving the robustness of visual defect segmentation in manufacturing components. Given the scarcity and imbalance of real-world defect data, synthetic data generation offers a promising solution for training deep learning models. We fine-tuned stable diffusion using the LoRA technique on the NEU-seg dataset and evaluated the impact of different ratios of synthetic to real images on the training set of DeepLabV3+ and FPN segmentation models. Our results demonstrated a significant improvement in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) when the training dataset was augmented with synthetic images. This study highlights the potential of diffusion models for enhancing the quality and diversity of training data in industrial defect detection, leading to more accurate and reliable segmentation results. The proposed approach achieved improvements of 5.95% and 6.85% in mIoU of defect segmentation on each model over the original dataset.

KW  - SPECTROSCOPY
KW  - EXTRACTION
AB  - Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) is a well-known third-order nonlinear spectroscopic technique utilized to analyze the molecule structures. However, it has a coherent non-resonant background (NRB) alongside with Raman resonant, thus, it is difficult to extract the Raman part. In this work, the Raman signal is extracted from the CARS spectrum by using a convolutional neural network. The model architecture is adapted from the original SpecNet model. The model is pre-trained with synthetic data and fine-tuned with semi-synthetic data based on two sets of semi-synthetic spectra. The experimental results show that the model achieves 86% accuracy in predicting the Raman signal of semi-synthetic data. In addition, the sensitivity of the model performance to varying levels of noise is analysed. Based on standard metrics, the model performance decreases with the increasing level of noise in a non-linear manner. Finally, the prediction capability of the fine-tuned SpecNet model was evaluated on the four experimental CARS spectra and the results were found to be better compared to SpecNet.

T2  - 2019 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON 3D VISION (3DV 2019)
LA  - English
CP  - 7th International Conference on 3D Vision (3DV)
AB  - We propose a novel computer vision system for reconstructing 3D body shapes from 2D images with the goal of producing highly accurate anthropomorphic measurements from a pair of images. We adopt a supervised learning approach that maps silhouette images to 3D body shapes via a convolutional neural network (CNN). We propose three key improvements over previous approaches: (1) Large-scale realistic synthetic data generation, including more realistic variations in segmentation noise and camera viewpoints. (2) A multi-task learning (MTL) approach to predicting multiple outputs such as shape, 3D joint locations, pose angles, and body volume. (3) A new network architecture that additionally takes known body measurements (e.g., height) and per-pixel segmentation confidence as input. Ablation studies show the improvement in accuracy due to the various components of our system. Results demonstrate that our system produces state-of-the-art results on body circumference errors. We also analyze the repeatability of our system in the presence of realistic camera, background, and pose variations. Our system achieves a vertex standard deviation of similar to 3mm on the CAESAR [36] dataset.

AB  - Skin cancer affects more than 3 million people only in the U.S. Comprehensive microscopic databases include around 30 thousand samples, limiting the richness of patterns that can be presented to machine learning. To this end, generative models such as GANs have been proposed for creating realistic synthetic images but, despite their popularity, they are often difficult to train and control. Recently an autoregressive approach based on a quantized autoencoder showed state of the art performances while being simple to train and provide synthetic data generation opportunities. In the first part of this paper we evaluate the training of VQ-VAE-2 with different latent space configuration. In the second part, we show how to use a learned prior over the latent space with PixelSNAIL to generate and modify skin lesions. We show how this process can be used for powerful data augmentation and visualization for skin health, evaluating it on a downstream application that classifies malignant lesions.

AB  - Kalman filter is a well-established accuracy correction method in control, guidance, and navigation. With the popularity of mobile communication and ICT, Kalman Filter has been used in many new applications related to positioning based on spatiotemporal data from the cellular network. Despite the low accuracy compared to Global Positioning System, the method is an excellent supplement to other positioning technologies. It is often used in sensor fusion setups as a complementary source. One of the reasons for the Kalman Filter's inaccuracy lies in naive radio coverage approximation techniques based on multivariate normal distributions assumed by previous studies. Therefore, in this paper, we evaluated those disadvantages and proposed a Gaussian mixtures model to address the non-arbitrary shape of the radio cells' coverage area. Having incorporated the Gaussian mixtures model into Switching Kalman Filter, we achieved better accuracy in positioning within the cellular network.

AB  - With the continuous popularization of smartphones and their ever-evolving photographic capabilities, individuals can easily take a large number of photos in their daily lives, creating a natural impetus for image editing. With the ability of style-based GAN, images can be reasonably edited on specific semantics by manipulating in latent space of the generator, particularly for human facial photographs. However, such methods are heavily rely on the datasets with diverse data and rich semantic annotations at the same time. Unfortunately, there is no such dataset for outdoor scenes with diverse and complex structural content, which makes current editing methods almost ineffective. To overcome these challenges, we first construct an extensive synthetic outdoor scene dataset with fine-grained semantic annotations based on an automated process. Based on it, we propose an editing network dedicated to multi-class annotations that can efficiently edit specific attributes while preserving others as much as possible. Extensive experiments evince that our method achieves better performance in outdoor scene editing, especially in regards to distance and viewpoint across several outdoor scene datasets.

CP  - IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)
AB  - Segmenting humans in 3D indoor scenes has become increasingly important with the rise of human-centered robotics and AR/VR applications. To this end, we propose the task of joint 3D human semantic segmentation, instance segmentation and multi-human body-part segmentation. Few works have attempted to directly segment humans in cluttered 3D scenes, which is largely due to the lack of annotated training data of humans interacting with 3D scenes. We address this challenge and propose a framework for generating training data of synthetic humans interacting with real 3D scenes. Furthermore, we propose a novel transformer-based model, Human3D, which is the first end-to-end model for segmenting multiple human instances and their body-parts in a unified manner. The key advantage of our synthetic data generation framework is its ability to generate diverse and realistic human-scene interactions, with highly accurate ground truth. Our experiments show that pre-training on synthetic data improves performance on a wide variety of 3D human segmentation tasks. Finally, we demonstrate that Human3D outperforms even task-specific state-of-the-art 3D segmentation methods.

AB  - Methods for synthetic data generation are extremely valuable nowadays since they allow researchers and practitioners to develop and test their models without the risk and cost associated with using real data. In this paper, we propose a method for the generation of synthetic financial time series. The method adopts time series regimes clustering to perform generative models training on the data from each cluster separately. Also, we suggest the modification of Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (QuantGAN) architecture that is able to produce synthetic data with frequency characteristics closer to the corresponding real-world time series ones. Our experiments show that (1) synthetic financial time series can be effectively generated by our method; (2) the distribution characteristics of synthetic time series generated by the method are closer to the initial ones in comparison with Fourier Flows and QuantGAN; (3) training the forecasting model on the synthetics generated by the proposed method (Fourier Flows model is used within it) can reduce the forecasting error on the real-world series.

AB  - High-quality structured data with rich annotations are critical components in intelligent vehicle systems dealing with road scenes. However, data curation and annotation require intensive investments and yield low-diversity scenarios. The recently growing interest in synthetic data raises questions about the scope of improvement in such systems and the amount of manual work still required to produce high volumes and variations of simulated data. This work proposes a synthetic data generation pipeline that utilizes existing datasets, like nuScenes, to address the difficulties and domain-gaps present in simulated datasets. We show that using annotations and visual cues from existing datasets, we can facilitate automated multi-modal data generation, mimicking real scene properties with high-fidelity, along with mechanisms to diversify samples in a physically meaningful way. We demonstrate improvements in mIoU metrics by presenting qualitative and quantitative experiments with real and synthetic data for semantic segmentation on the Cityscapes and KITTI-STEP datasets. All relevant code and data is released on github(3) (https://github.com/shubham1810/trove_toolkit).

AB  - Traditional Machine Learning (ML) pipeline development requires the ML practitioner to directly access the data to analyze, clean and preprocess it, in order to develop an ML model, train it and evaluate its performance. When the data owner has no infrastructure for in-house development, such pipelines are outsourced. It is common that data has some level of privacy constraints that will impose a laborious and maybe expensive infrastructure, including among others contracts drafting and infrastructure improvement. Traditional approaches rely either on anonymization which does not entirely protect from identity disclosure, or on synthetic data generation which requires expertise not necessarily available to the organization. In this paper, we present Data-Blind ML, an automated framework, fueled by synthetic generative learning and distributed computing paradigms, which enables an organization to outsource the development and training of ML models without sharing any sample from the real dataset. In addition, the framework allows the ML practitioner to get feedback of the model's performance against the actual real data without accessing it directly.

AB  - In recent years, learning from imbalanced data has attracted growing attention from both academia and industry due to the explosive growth of applications that use and produce imbalanced data. However, because of the complex characteristics of imbalanced data, many real-world solutions struggle to provide robust efficiency in learning-based applications. In an effort to address this problem, this paper presents Ranked Minority Over-sampling in Boosting (RAMOBoost), which is a RAMO technique based on the idea of adaptive synthetic data generation in an ensemble learning system. Briefly, RAMOBoost adaptively ranks minority class instances at each learning iteration according to a sampling probability distribution that is based on the underlying data distribution, and can adaptively shift the decision boundary toward difficult-to-learn minority and majority class instances by using a hypothesis assessment procedure. Simulation analysis on 19 real-world datasets assessed over various metrics-including overall accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure, G-mean, and receiver operation characteristic analysis-is used to illustrate the effectiveness of this method.

AB  - In this study hourly wind speed time series data of Eskisehir region, Turkey have been used for stochastic generation of wind speed data using the transition matrix approach of the Markov chain process. Previous work on Synthetic data generation did not focus on the effects of different choices of wind states. In this work, it was observed that increasing the number of states has a significant benefit in terms of generated data quality. Two different Markov models are constructed. In first model 13 wind states are used whereas in the second model 26 wind states are used to form the transition probability matrices of the model. The algorithm to generate the wind speed time series from the transition probability matrices is presented. The generated data from both models are compared with observed ones. The comparison of the observed wind speed and the generated ones shows that statistical characteristics are satisfactorily preserved. Furthermore increasing the dimension of state space of the Markov model gives more accurate results.

AB  - In neurorehabilitation, assessment of functional problems is essential to define optimal rehabilitation treatments. Usually, this assessment process requires distinguishing between impaired and non-impaired behavior of limbs. One of the common muscle motor disorders affecting limbs is spasticity, which is complicated to quantify objectively due to the complex nature of motor control. Thus, the lack of heterogeneous samples of patients constituting an acceptable amount of data is an obstacle which is relevant to understanding the behavior of spasticity and, consequently, quantifying it. In this article, we use the 3D creation suite Blender combined with the MBLab add-on to generate synthetic samples of human body models, aiming to be as sufficiently representative as possible to real human samples. Exporting these samples to OpenSim and performing four specific upper limb movements, we analyze the muscle behavior by simulating the six degrees of spasticity contemplated by the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS). The complete dataset of patients and movements is open-source and available for future research. This approach advocates the potential to generate synthetic data for testing and validating musculoskeletal models.

AB  - The Galactic Center (GC) of the Milky Way, thanks to its proximity, allows to perform astronomical observations that investigate physical phenomena at the edge of astrophysics and fundamental physics. As such, it offers a unique laboratory to probe gravity, where one can not only test the basic predictions of general relativity (GR), but is also able to falsify theories that, over time, have been proposed to modify or extend GR; to test different paradigms of dark matter; and to place constraints on putative models that have been formulated as alternatives to the standard black hole paradigm in GR. In this review we provide a general overview of the history of observations of the GC, emphasizing the importance, in particular on the smallest-observable scales, that they had in opening a new avenue to improve our understanding of the underlying theory of gravity in the surrounding of a supermassive compact object.

AB  - Technical and non-technical losses in distribution circuits result in significant economic costs to power utilities. One type of non-technical loss is energy theft by various means including illegal tapping of feeders, bypassing the meter, and billing fraud. These losses are usually hard to detect, and can remain undetected for long periods of time. Machine learning models have been proven effective in detecting these conditions, but rely on the availability of large, good-quality training data sets. The problem is exacerbated by the imbalanced nature of data related to these conditions-energy theft, though costly, is very rare. The available data sets generally have very few samples of theft with most of the data pertaining to normal operation. Such data sets are generally not suitable to train machine learning models. In this paper, an overview of energy theft detection techniques, the challenges with their data needs, and the limitations of current techniques to bridge such data limitations is presented. A co-simulation framework is proposed to generate reliable training data for machine learning algorithms for theft detection. An example scenario is presented and a machine learning model is built to detect certain kinds of energy theft.

AB  - COVID-19 was responsible for devastating social, economic, and political effects all over the world. Although the health authorities imposed restrictions provided relief and assisted with trying to return society to normal life, it is imperative to monitor people's behavior and risk factors to keep virus transmission levels as low as possible. This article focuses on the application of deep learning algorithms to detect the presence of masks on people in public spaces (using RGB cameras), as well as the detection of the caruncle in the human eye area to make an accurate measurement of body temperature (using thermal cameras). For this task, synthetic data generation techniques were used to create hybrid datasets from public ones to train state-of-the-art algorithms, such as YOLOv5 object detector and a keypoint detector based on Resnet-50. For RGB mask detection, YOLOv5 achieved an average precision of 82.4%. For thermal masks, glasses, and caruncle detection, YOLOv5 and keypoint detector achieved an average precision of 96.65% and 78.7%, respectively. Moreover, RGB and thermal datasets were made publicly available.

AB  - In this paper a deep learning architecture is presented that can, in real time, detect the 2D locations of certain landmarks of physical tools, such as a hammer or screwdriver. To avoid the labor of manual labeling, the network is trained on synthetically generated data. Training computer vision models on computer generated images, while still achieving good accuracy on real images, is a challenge due to the difference in domain. The proposed method uses an advanced rendering method in combination with transfer learning and an intermediate supervision architecture to address this problem. It is shown that the model presented in this paper, named Intermediate Heatmap Model (IHM), generalizes to real images when trained on synthetic data. To avoid the need for an exact textured 3D model of the tool in question, it is shown that the model will generalize to an unseen tool when trained on a set of different 3D models of the same type of tool. IHM is compared to two existing approaches to keypoint detection and it is shown that it outperforms those at detecting tool landmarks, trained on synthetic data.

AB  - Synthetic data are frequently used to supplement a small set of real images and create a dataset with diverse features, but this may not improve the equivariance of a computer vision model. Our work answers the following questions: First, what metrics are useful for measuring a domain gap between real and synthetic data distributions? Second, is there an effective method for bridging an observed domain gap? We explore these questions by presenting a pathological case where the inclusion of synthetic data did not improve model performance, then presenting measurements of the difference between the real and synthetic distributions in the image space, latent space, and model prediction space. We find that augmenting the dataset with pixel-level augmentation effectively reduced the observed domain gap, and improves the model F1 score to 0.95 compared to 0.43 for un-augmented data. We also observe that an increase in the average cross entropy of the latent space feature vectors is positively correlated with increased model equivariance and the closing of the domain gap. The results are explained using a framework of model regularization effects.

We show how different methods of waveform generation with the same signal-to-noise ratios result in varied accuracy performance for modulation recognition when using neural networks (NNs). Our research indicates that two aspects of waveform generation significantly change NN behavior with equivalent SNRs. First, generating purely random IQ constellation points adversely impacts classification accuracy, as real radios do not have completely random constellation points. We illustrate that NNs can use the intermediate IQ samples to improve classification accuracy. Second, we exhibit that adding pure additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) results in different accuracies compared to using channel distortion models, which include fading, multipath, and phase shifts. We show that relying on SNR alone to characterize signals can result in misleading and incorrect performance evaluations of NNs when applied to radio performance. Our work also demonstrates that care must be taken when applying channels models to simulate noise, as NNs can use specific channel distortion features to identify a modulation.

AB  - This paper introduces a novel and cost-effective method for detecting adulterated diesel, specifically targeting contamination with kerosene, by leveraging machine learning and the refractive index values of mixed diesel samples. It proposes a laser-based sensor, employing COMSOL simulations for synthetic data generation to facilitate machine learning training. This innovative approach not only streamlines the detection process by eliminating the need for expensive equipment and specialized personnel but also enables on-site testing without extensive sample preparation. The sensor's design, utilizing light refraction and reflection principles, allows for the accurate measurement of diesel adulteration levels. Validation results showcase the machine learning models' high precision in predicting adulteration percentages, as evidenced by an R-squared value of 0.999 and a mean absolute error of 0.074. This research signifies a leap in sensor technology, offering a practical solution for rapid diesel adulteration detection, especially in developing countries, by minimizing reliance on advanced laboratory analyses. The sensor's design aligns with the requirements for low-cost IoT technology, presenting a versatile tool for various applications.

AB  - This paper studies the synthesis of high-dimensional datasets with differential privacy (DP). The state-of-the-art solution addresses this problem by first generating a setM of noisy low-dimensional marginals of the input data.., and then use them to approximate the data distribution in.. for synthetic data generation. However, it imposes several constraints on M that considerably limits the choices of marginals. This makes it difficult to capture all important correlations among attributes, which in turn degrades the quality of the resulting synthetic data.
   To address the above deficiency, we propose PrivMRF, a method that (i) also utilizes a setM of low-dimensional marginals for synthesizing high-dimensional data with DP, but (ii) provides a high degree of flexibility in the choices of marginals. The key idea of PrivMRF is to select an appropriateM to construct a Markov random field (MRF) that models the correlations among the attributes in the input data, and then use the MRF for data synthesis. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets show that PrivMRF consistently outperforms the state of the art in terms of the accuracy of counting queries and classification tasks conducted on the synthetic data generated.

AB  - On-board video sensors on large ships capture video data at high rates and provide real-time object tracking for maritime applications such as piracy and illegal fishing. High volumes of collected video and imagery data require advanced technology to analyze the video feeds, reduce data smog, and alert the crew on ships or coastal guard when unusual activities are detected. We present an integrated end-to-end system that analyzes multi-camera ship video feed; localizes maritime vessels in the video feed; identifies the maritime vessel over multiple cameras; maps the vessel track onto an overhead plane; and identifies anomalous vessel movement around the ship. In this paper, we focus on a specific activity detection approach in maritime vessel overhead tracks and on synthetic data generation to realistically model maritime boat movements around onboard ship cameras using real-world examples. We propose and compare three novel modes of trajectory analysis and activity classification, using Computing with Words (CWW), a Markov trajectory feature classifier (MTFC), and Naive Bayes Radial Classifier (NBRC) to detect the activity of vessel approaching the ship, vessel chasing another vessel, and vessel circling around the ship.

AB  - Synthetic data generation has been a growing area of research in recent years. However, its potential applications in serious games have yet to be thoroughly explored. Advances in this field could anticipate data modeling and analysis, as well as speed up the development process. To fill this gap in the literature, we propose a simulator architecture for generating probabilistic synthetic data for decision-based serious games. This architecture is designed to be versatile and modular so that it can be used by other researchers on similar problems (e.g., multiple choice exams, political surveys, any type of questionnaire). To simulate the interaction of synthetic players with the game, we use a cognitive testing model based on the Item Response Theory framework. We also show how probabilistic graphical models (in particular, Bayesian networks) can introduce expert knowledge and external data into the simulation. Finally, we apply the proposed architecture and methods in the case of a serious game focused on cyberbullying. We perform Bayesian inference experiments using a hierarchical model to demonstrate the identifiability and robustness of the generated data.

AB  - Class imbalance is a prevalent problem that not only reduces the performance of the machine learning techniques but also causes the lacking of the inherent complex characteristics of data. Though the researchers have proposed various ways to deal with the problem, they have yet to consider how to select a proper treatment, especially when uncertainty levels are high. Applying rough-fuzzy theory to the imbalanced data learning problem could be a promising research direction that generates the synthetic data and removes the outliers. The proposed work identifies the positive, boundary, and negative regions of the target set using the rough set theory and removes the objects in the negative region as outliers. It also explores the positive and boundary regions of the rough set by applying the fuzzy theory to generate the samples of the minority class and remove the samples of the majority class. Thus the proposed rough-fuzzy approach performs both oversampling and undersampling to handle the imbalanced class problem. The experimental results demonstrate that the novel technique allows qualitative and quantitative data handling.

AB  - Discriminative pattern mining looks for association patterns that occur more frequently in one class than another and has important applications in many areas including finding biomarkers in biomedical data. However, finding such patterns is challenging because higher order combinations of variables may show high discrimination even when single variables or lower-order combinations show little or no discrimination. Thus, generating such patterns is important for evaluating discriminative pattern mining algorithms and better understanding the nature of discriminative patterns. To that end, we describe how such patterns can be defined using mathematical constraints which are then solved with widely available software that generates solutions for the resulting optimization problem. We present a basic formulation of the problem obtained from a straightforward translation of the desired pattern characteristics into mathematical constraints, and then show how the pattern generation problem can be reformulated in terms of the selection of rows from a truth table. This formulation is more efficient and provides deeper insight into the process of creating higher order patterns. It also makes it easy to define patterns other than just those based on the conjunctive logic used by traditional association and discriminant pattern analysis.

AB  - Synthetic data generation to improve classification performance (data augmentation) is a well-studied problem. Recently, generative adversarial networks (GAN) have shown superior image data augmentation performance, but their suitability in gesture synthesis has received inadequate attention. Further, GANs prohibitively require simultaneous generator and discriminator network training. We tackle both issues in this work. We first discuss a novel, device-agnostic GAN model for gesture synthesis called DeepGAN. Thereafter, we formulate DeepNAG by introducing a new differentiable loss function based on dynamic time warping and the average Hausdorff distance, which allows us to train DeepGAN's generator without requiring a discriminator. Through evaluations, we compare the utility of DeepGAN and DeepNAG against two alternative techniques for training five recognizers using data augmentation over six datasets. We further investigate the perceived quality of synthesized samples via an Amazon Mechanical Turk user study based on the HYPE infinity benchmark. We find that DeepNAG outperforms DeepGAN in accuracy, training time (up to 17x faster), and realism, thereby opening the door to a new line of research in generator network design and training for gesture synthesis.

KW  - DENSITY
AB  - Synthetic data generation has become a key ingredient for training machine learning procedures, addressing tasks such as data augmentation, analysing privacy-sensitive data, or visualising representative samples. Assessing the quality of such synthetic data generators hence has to be addressed. As (deep) generative models for synthetic data often do not admit explicit probability distributions, classical statistical procedures for assessing model goodness-of-fit may not be applicable. In this paper, we propose a principled procedure to assess the quality of a synthetic data generator. The procedure is a kernelised Stein discrepancy (KSD)-type test which is based on a non-parametric Stein operator for the synthetic data generator of interest. This operator is estimated from samples which are obtained from the synthetic data generator and hence can be applied even when the model is only implicit. In contrast to classical testing, the sample size from the synthetic data generator can be as large as desired, while the size of the observed data which the generator aims to emulate is fixed. Experimental results on synthetic distributions and trained generative models on synthetic and real datasets illustrate that the method shows improved power performance compared to existing approaches.

AB  - The stochastic nature of energy demand and renewable energy (RE) resources make the design of hybrid renewable energy systems as a complex problem. In this paper, an innovative stochastic optimization approach is proposed for optimal sizing of hybrid renewable energy systems (HRES) incorporating existing uncertainties in RE resources and energy load. The design problem is formulated based on multi-objective optimization framework with three objective functions including minimize total net present cost (NPC), maximize renewable energy ratio (RER), and minimize fuel emission. The reliability index named loss of load probability (LLP) is considered as a constraint with a desirable level. The Pareto front (PF) of developed multi-objective optimization problem is approximated with the help of the integration of dynamic multi-objective particle swarm optimization (DMOPSO) algorithm, simulation module, and sampling average method. Synthetic data generation approaches are applied to tackle the randomness in wind speed, solar irradiation, ambient temperature, and energy load. A building located in Canada is used as the case study to assess the performance of the developed model. Finally, the obtained PF by the stochastic optimization approach is examined against the deterministic PF using the most famous performance metrics.

AB  - In this paper, we propose the use of GANs as learned, data-driven knowledge database that can be queried for rapid synthesis of suitable antenna designs given a desired response. As an example, we consider the problem of designing the Log-Periodic Folded Dipole Array (LPFDA) antenna for two non-overlapping ranges of Q-factor values. By representing the antenna with the vector of its structural parameters and considering each desirable range of the Q-factor as a class, we transform our problem to that of generating new samples from a given class. We develop two alternative models, a Conditional Wasserstein GAN and a label-switched library of vanilla Wasserstein GANs and train them with a dataset of features and their associated labels (parameter vectors and Q-factor range). The main component of these models is a generator network that learns to map a normally distributed noise vector along with a binary label to the vector of parameters of candidate structures. We demonstrate that in inference mode, these models can be relied upon for fast generation of suitable designs.

AB  - Quality of Experience (QoE) models need good generalization that necessitates sufficient amount of user-labeled datasets associated with measurements related to underlying QoE factors. However, obtaining QoE datasets is often costly, since they are preferably collected from many subjects with diverse background, and eventually dataset sizes and representations are limited. Models can be improved by sharing and merging those collected local datasets, however regulations such as GDPR make data sharing difficult, as those local user datasets might contain sensitive information about the subjects. A privacy-preserving machine learning approach such as Federated Learning (FL) is a potential candidate that enables sharing of QoE data models between collaborators without exposing ground truth, but only by means of sharing the securely aggregated form of extracted model parameters. While FL can enable a seamless QoE model management, if collaborators do not have the same level of data quality, more iterations of information sharing over a communication channel might be necessary for models to reach an acceptable accuracy. In this paper, we present an ensemble based Bayesian synthetic data generation method for FL, LOO (Leave-One-Out), which reduces the training time by 30% and the network footprint in the communication channel by 60%.

CP  - 37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS)
AB  - Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in generative modeling tasks across various domains. Prior works on time series diffusion models have primarily focused on developing conditional models tailored to specific forecasting or imputation tasks. In this work, we explore the potential of task-agnostic, unconditional diffusion models for several time series applications. We propose TSDiff, an unconditionally-trained diffusion model for time series. Our proposed self-guidance mechanism enables conditioning TSDiff for downstream tasks during inference, without requiring auxiliary networks or altering the training procedure. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on three different time series tasks: forecasting, refinement, and synthetic data generation. First, we show that TSDiff is competitive with several task-specific conditional forecasting methods (predict). Second, we leverage the learned implicit probability density of TSDiff to iteratively refine the predictions of base forecasters with reduced computational overhead over reverse diffusion (refine). Notably, the generative performance of the model remains intact - downstream forecasters trained on synthetic samples from TSDiff outperform forecasters that are trained on samples from other state-of-the-art generative time series models, occasionally even outperforming models trained on real data (synthesize).

AB  - Machine Learning (ML) models are progressively deployed in many real-world applications to perform a wide range of tasks, but are exposed to the security and privacy threats which aim to infer the details and even steal the functionality of the ML models. Despite extensive attacking efforts which rely on white-box or gray-box access, how to perform attacks with black-box access continues to be elusive. Aspiring to fill this gap, we move one step further and present ML-Stealer that can steal the functionality of any type of ML models with mere black-box access. With two algorithm designs, namely, synthetic data generation and replica model construction, ML-Stealer can construct a deep neural network (DNN)-based replica model which has the similar prediction functionality to the victim ML model. ML-Stealer does not require any knowledge about the victim model, nor does it enforce the access to statistical information or samples of the victim's training data. Experiment results demonstrate that ML-Stealer can achieve the consistent prediction results with the victim model of an averaged testing accuracy of 85.6%, and up to 93.6% at best.

AB  - In this paper, novel approaches for wind speed data generation using Mycielski algorithm are developed and presented. To show the accuracy of developed approaches, we used three-year collected wind speed data belonging to deliberately selected two different regions of Turkey (Izmir and Kayseri) to generate artificial wind speed data. The data belonging to the first two years are used for training, whereas the remaining one-year data are used for testing and accuracy comparison purposes. The concept of distinct synthetic data production with correlation-wise and distribution-wise similar statistical properties constitutes the main idea of the proposed methods for a successful artificial wind speed generation. Generated data are compared with test data for both regions in the sense of basic statistics, Weibull distribution parameters, transition probabilities, spectral densities, and autocorrelation functions; and are also compared with the data generated by the classical first-order Markov chains method. Results indicate that the accuracy and realistic behavior of the proposed method is superior to the classical method in the literature. Comparisons and results are discussed in detail.

AB  - New functionality to process Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) data has been implemented in the CASA package. This includes two new tasks to handle fringe fitting and VLBI-specific amplitude calibration steps. Existing tasks have been adjusted to handle VLBI visibility data and calibration meta-data properly. With these updates, it is now possible to process VLBI continuum and spectral line observations in CASA. This article describes the development and implementation, and presents an outline for the workflow when calibrating European VLBI Network or Very Long Baseline Array data in CASA. Though the CASA VLBI functionality has already been vetted extensively as part of the Event Horizon Telescope data processing, in this paper we compare results for the same data set processed in CASA and AIPS. We find identical results for the two packages and conclude that CASA in some cases performs better, though it cannot match AIPS for single-core processing time. The new functionality in CASA allows for easy development of pipelines or Jupyter notebooks, and thus contributes to raising VLBI data processing to present day standards for accessibility, reproducibility, and reusability.

TI  - Volcanic Ash and SO<sub>2</sub> retrievals using synthetic MODIS TIR data: comparison between inversion procedures and sensitivity analysis
T2  - ANNALS OF GEOPHYSICS
LA  - English
AB  - In this work the volcanic ash and SO2 retrievals obtained by applying three different procedures (LUT - Look Up Table, NN - Neural Network and VPR - Volcanic Plume Removal) on MODIS Thermal InfraRed (TIR) synthetic measurements have been compared. The synthetic measurements are generated using MODTRAN Radiative Transfer Model (RTM) for defined volcanic cloud configurations. The results, presented as the percentage difference between the retrieved ash and SO2 total masses and the true values used for the synthetic data generation, indicate maximum differences of +/- 15% and +/- 10% for all the procedures and for ash and SO2 retrievals respectively. A sensitivity analysis has been also realized to investigate the influence of volcanic cloud altitude and water vapour profile on SO2 retrievals at 7.3 and 8.6 m m. Results confirm the high sensitivity of the 7.3 m m retrieval to the volcanic cloud altitude and show that the SO2 total masses estimated at 7.3 and 8.6 m m separately can be used to improve the information on the plume height. Finally, the water vapour profile is used to compute the minimum altitude over which the 7.3 m m retrieval is effective.

AB  - Mental health problems impact the quality of life of millions of people around the world. However, diagnosis of mental health disorders is a challenging problem that often relies on self-reporting by patients about their behavioral patterns and social interactions. Therefore, there is a need for new strategies for diagnosis and daily monitoring of mental health conditions. The recent introduction of body-area networks consisting of a plethora of accurate sensors embedded in smartwatches and smartphones and edge-compatible deep neural networks (DNNs) points toward a possible solution. Such wearable medical sensors (WMSs) enable continuous monitoring of physiological signals in a passive and non-invasive manner. However, disease diagnosis based on WMSs and DNNs, and their deployment on edge devices, such as smartphones, remains a challenging problem. These challenges stem from the difficulty of feature engineering and knowledge distillation from the raw sensor data, as well as the computational and memory constraints of battery-operated edge devices. To this end, we propose a framework called MHDeep that utilizes commercially available WMSs and efficient DNN models to diagnose three important mental health disorders: schizoaffective, major depressive, and bipolar. MHDeep uses eight different categories of data obtained from sensors integrated in a smartwatch and smartphone. These categories include various physiological signals and additional information on motion patterns and environmental variables related to the wearer. MHDeep eliminates the need for manual feature engineering by directly operating on the data streams obtained from participants. Because the amount of data is limited, MHDeep uses a synthetic data generation module to augment real data with synthetic data drawn from the same probability distribution. We use the synthetic dataset to pre-train the weights of the DNN models, thus imposing a prior on the weights. We use a grow-and-prune DNN synthesis approach to learn both architecture and weights during the training process. We use three different data partitions to evaluate the MHDeep models trained with data collected from 74 individuals. We conduct two types of evaluations: at the data instance level and at the patient level. MHDeep achieves an average test accuracy, across the three data partitions, of 90.4%, 87.3%, and 82.4%, respectively, for classifications between healthy and schizoaffective disorder instances, healthy and major depressive disorder instances, and healthy and bipolar disorder instances. At the patient level, MHDeep DNN models achieve an accuracy of 100%, 100%, and 90.0% for the three mental health disorders, respectively, based on inference that uses 40, 16, and 22 minutes of sensor data collection from each patient.

AB  - Within the asset management industry, the portfolio selection problem stands as one of the most important challenges. The approaches that experts have taken to address this problem have ranged from intuition-based decisions to sophisticated optimization frameworks. In this paper, we introduce a novel portfolio optimization methodology for investors with a medium- to long-term horizon focusing on public markets via index funds. Our method marries a Markowitz-inspired framework with a Conditional-Value-at-Risk (CVaR) constraint, and employs synthetic data generated through a Modified Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CTGAN) approach that incorporates contextual information, specifically, the U.S. Treasury yield curve. The synthetic data generation algorithm captures the essential structure of the training dataset, while the CVaR-based optimization leads to portfolios with very good out-of-sample performance. This study emphasizes the merits of integrating contextual information and demonstrates the generative networks superiority over traditional approaches based solely on historical data. This innovative approach lays the groundwork for further advancements in asset allocation strategies fueled by synthetic data generating processes.

AB  - The protection of private information is of vital importance in data-driven research, business and government. The conflict between privacy and utility has triggered intensive research in the computer science and statistics communities, who have developed a variety of methods for privacy-preserving data release. Among the main concepts that have emerged are anonymity and differential privacy. Today, another solution is gaining traction, synthetic data. However, the road to privacy is paved with NP-hard problems. In this paper, we focus on the NP-hard challenge to develop a synthetic data generation method that is computationally efficient, comes with provable privacy guarantees and rigorously quantifies data utility. We solve a relaxed version of this problem by studying a fundamental, but a first glance completely unrelated, problem in probability concerning the concept of covariance loss. Namely, we find a nearly optimal and constructive answer to the question how much information is lost when we take conditional expectation. Surprisingly, this excursion into theoretical probability produces mathematical techniques that allow us to derive constructive, approximately optimal solutions to difficult applied problems concerning microaggregation, privacy and synthetic data.

AB  - Electrically-assisted double-sided incremental forming (EA-DSIF) is a flexible forming method suitable for processing hard-to-form materials and complex-shaped parts. A challenge in EA-DSIF experiments is temperature measurement. Since the localized forming zone is blocked by the tools, it is not possible to measure the actual forming temperature distribution in the forming zone. To address this issue, we propose an artificial neural network (ANN) framework for predicting the forming temperature using measurements of the surrounding temperature and toolpath features. The ANN model was trained using the temperature outputs of finite element models. A simplified EA-DSIF simulation model was developed for computational efficiency needed for synthetic data generation. Model simplifications were justified in multiple cases and validated with experimental data by comparing the temperatures from positions that is visible to an infrared camera. The feasibility of applying the developed ANN model to untrained geometries and in practical applications was demonstrated. The findings generated from this study are crucial for selecting optimum process parameters, estimating the forming force, and predicting microstructure evolution during EA-DSIF.

AB  - Automatic maturity recognition and counting of tomatoes during different growth stages from images is of great significance for optimal management in tomato farming, long-term yield prediction and robotic harvesting. In this study, we present a novel method that combines deep instance segmentation, data synthesis and color analysis to accurately recognize and count tomatoes during different growth stages. In our approach, we trained the Mask R-CNN instance segmentation neural network with synthetically generated dataset to accurately segment all tomato instances in an image, then color-based thresholding was applied to identify their growth stage and count the tomato number accordingly. The synthetic data generation algorithm preserved the physical structure of the data objects, thus produced photorealistic synthesized cultivation scenes. The trained model demonstrated substantial performance with maximum 92.1% average precision and 91.4% recall against the real-world test datasets for tomato segmentation. The tomato maturity recognition accuracy of the color-analysis method was evaluated by comparing estimated count with ground-truth manual counts. Our experimental results demonstrated high accuracy of tomato counting during three different growth stages: green, half ripened and fully ripened.

AB  - Many deep learning tasks require annotations that are too time consuming for human operators, resulting in small dataset sizes. This is especially true for dense regression problems such as crowd counting which requires the location of every person in the image to be annotated. Techniques such as data augmentation and synthetic data generation based on simulations can help in such cases. In this paper, we introduce PromptMix, a method for artificially boosting the size of existing datasets, that can be used to improve the performance of lightweight networks. First, synthetic images are generated in an end-to-end data-driven manner, where text prompts are extracted from existing datasets via an image captioning deep network, and subsequently introduced to text-to-image diffusion models. The generated images are then annotated using one or more high-performing deep networks, and mixed with the real dataset for training the lightweight network. By extensive experiments on five datasets and two tasks, we show that PromptMix can significantly increase the performance of lightweight networks by up to 26%.

AB  - In Machine Learning, large models need to have access to a huge amount of training data. This requirement applies to many applications in an industrial environment. Furthermore, in specific processes it is not easy to obtain such a large amount of data for different reasons ranging from privacy, security, and even process affectations. Therefore, this work proposes the creation of synthetic time series datasets to simulate processes out of a given subset of functional relationships. Moreover, using transfer learning to improve the performance of four autoencoder architectures in terms of unsupervised time series reconstruction, requiring fewer target data for training. We outline multiple concepts of data generation and use statistical analysis to evaluate the dataset performance and complexity. Further, the data is used to train unsupervised models and enables them to improve their reconstruction performance over 52 sensors and multiple fault cases. By reducing the amount of available train data, we still gain sufficient results through the pre-training. Overall, we see significant performance and interpretability improvements on a new time series analysis approach named Bag-of-Functions compared to convolutional and linear autoencoders.

AB  - Usage-based statistical testing employs knowledge about the actual or anticipated usage profile of the system under test for estimating system reliability. For many systems, usage-based statistical testing involves generating synthetic test data. Such data must possess the same statistical characteristics as the actual data that the system will process during operation. Synthetic test data must further satisfy any logical validity constraints that the actual data is subject to. Targeting data-intensive systems, we propose an approach for generating synthetic test data that is both statistically representative and logically valid. The approach works by first generating a data sample that meets the desired statistical characteristics, without taking into account the logical constraints. Subsequently, the approach tweaks the generated sample to fix any logical constraint violations. The tweaking process is iterative and continuously guided toward achieving the desired statistical characteristics. We report on a realistic evaluation of the approach, where we generate a synthetic population of citizens' records for testing a public administration IT system. Results suggest that our approach is scalable and capable of simultaneously fulfilling the statistical representativeness and logical validity requirements.

AB  - Remote sensing often utilizes models to predict the ability of an optical system to collect data optimally prior to costly sensor testing and manufacturing. Significant effort is required to create an accurate model, and therefore most designs focus on either radiometric or spatial precision rather than a combination of the two. We present a case study in which a model has been created to satisfy both radiometric and spatial fidelity requirements. Terrain, vegetation, targets and other components of the model were designed with high precision. Hyperspectral imagery was generated using the Digital Imaging and Remote Sensing Image Generation Model (DIRSIG) based on numerous spectral and spatial ground-truth measurements. These included spectral reflectance of targets and the environment, atmospheric variables, as well as geometry and distribution of objects within the scene. Imagery was collected by airborne systems for accuracy assessment. The generated data has been validated by qualitative evaluation of the spectral characteristics and comparisons of results from PC transform and the RX anomaly detection algorithm. Validation results indicate that the model achieved a desired level of accuracy.

AB  - Cyberattacks from within an organization's trusted entities are known as insider threats. Anomaly detection using deep learning requires comprehensive data, but insider threat data is not readily available due to confidentiality concerns of organizations. Therefore, there arises demand to generate synthetic data to explore enhanced approaches for threat analysis. We propose a linear manifold learning -based generative adversarial network, SPCAGAN, that takes input from heterogeneous data sources and adds a novel loss function to train the generator to produce high -quality data that closely resembles the original data distribution. Furthermore, we introduce a deep learning -based hybrid model for insider threat analysis. We provide extensive experiments for data synthesis, anomaly detection, adversarial robustness, and synthetic data quality analysis using benchmark datasets. In this context, empirical comparisons show that GAN-based oversampling is competitive with numerous typical oversampling regimes. For synthetic data generation, our SPCAGAN model overcame the problem of mode collapse and converged faster than previous GAN models. Results demonstrate that our proposed approach has a lower error, is more accurate, and generates substantially superior synthetic insider threat data than previous models.

AB  - The fault diagnosis during drilling is necessary to prevent the accidents develop to more serious status. Data-driven diagnosis methods have great advantages in nonlinear industrial process, however, the problem of limited samples restricts its further application. This article proposes a data augmentation method based on synthetic data generation and updating for drilling fault diagnosis with limited samples. First, the generator is trained with generative adversarial nets (GAN), and the GAN is improved by the design of parameter selection module, and loss function in generative model. Then, sufficient samples are obtained, and a balanced dataset is constructed for modeling. Meanwhile, by considering the distribution discrepancy, the self-organizing incremental neural network-based synthetic data updating is realized to track the changes of data distribution when the data drift appears. Finally, the actual data acquired from two wells are employed for the method validation. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed method is helpful for improving the performance of diagnosis model with limited samples, and the negative impact to diagnosis model due to the distribution discrepancy also can be overcome.

AB  - Vehicle-to-Vehicle communication can improve traffic safety and efficiency. This technology, however, increases the attack surface, making new attacks possible. To cope with these threats, researchers have made a great effort to identify and explore the potential of cyberattacks and also proposed various intrusion or misbehaviour detection systems, in particular machine learning-based solutions. Simulations have become essential to design and evaluate such detection systems as there are no real publicly available Vehicular Ad-Hoc Network (VANET) datasets containing a variety of attacks. The drawback is that simulations require a significant amount of computational resources and time for configuration.
   In this paper, we present an attack simulation and generation framework that allows training the attack generator with either simulated or real VANET attacks. We outline the structure of our proposed framework and describe the setup of a standard compliant attack simulator that generates valid standardised CAM and DENM messages specified by ETSI in the Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) standards. Based on the introduced framework, we demonstrate the feasibility of using deep learning for the generation of VANET attacks, which ultimately allows us to test and verify prototypes without running resource-demanding simulations.

AB  - Variable (feature) selection plays an important role in data analysis and mathematical modeling. This paper aims to address the significant lack of formal evaluation benchmarks for feature selection algorithms (FSAs). To evaluate FSAs effectively, controlled environments are required, and the use of synthetic datasets offers significant advantages. We introduce a set of ten synthetically generated datasets with known relevance, redundancy, and irrelevance of features, derived from various mathematical, logical, and geometric sources. Additionally, eight FSAs are evaluated on these datasets based on their relevance and novelty. The paper first introduces the datasets and then provides a comprehensive experimental analysis of the performance of the selected FSAs on these datasets including testing the FSAs' resilience on two types of induced data noise. The analysis has guided the grouping of the generated datasets into four groups of data complexity. Lastly, we provide public access to the generated datasets to facilitate bench-marking of new feature selection algorithms in the field via our Github repository. The contributions of this paper aim to foster the development of novel feature selection algorithms and advance their study.

AB  - Test collections play a vital role in evaluation of information retrieval (IR) systems. Obtaining a diverse set of user queries for test collection construction can be challenging, and acquiring relevance judgments, which indicate the appropriateness of retrieved documents to a query, is often costly and resource-intensive. Generating synthetic datasets using Large Language Models (LLMs) has recently gained significant attention in various applications. In IR, while previous work exploited the capabilities of LLMs to generate synthetic queries or documents to augment training data and improve the performance of ranking models, using LLMs for constructing synthetic test collections is relatively unexplored. Previous studies demonstrate that LLMs have the potential to generate synthetic relevance judgments for use in the evaluation of IR systems. In this paper, we comprehensively investigate whether it is possible to use LLMs to construct fully synthetic test collections by generating not only synthetic judgments but also synthetic queries. In particular, we analyse whether it is possible to construct reliable synthetic test collections and the potential risks of bias such test collections may exhibit towards LLM-based models. Our experiments indicate that using LLMs it is possible to construct synthetic test collections that can reliably be used for retrieval evaluation.

AB  - Data modeling requires a sufficient sample size for reproducibility. A small sample size can inhibit model evaluation. A synthetic data generation technique addressing this small sample size problem is evaluated: from the space of arbitrarily distributed samples, a subgroup (class) has a latent multivariate normal characteristic; synthetic data can be generated from this class with univariate kernel density estimation (KDE); and synthetic samples are statistically like their respective samples. Three samples (n = 667) were investigated with 10 input variables (X). KDE was used to augment the sample size in X. Maps produced univariate normal variables in Y. Principal component analysis in Y produced uncorrelated variables in T, where the probability density functions were approximated as normal and characterized; synthetic data was generated with normally distributed univariate random variables in T. Reversing each step produced synthetic data in Y and X. All samples were approximately multivariate normal in Y, permitting the generation of synthetic data. Probability density function and covariance comparisons showed similarity between samples and synthetic samples. A class of samples has a latent normal characteristic. For such samples, this approach offers a solution to the small sample size problem. Further studies are required to understand this latent class.

AB  - The human ear has distinguishing features that can be used for identification. Automated ear detection from 3D profile face images plays a vital role in ear-based human recognition. This work proposes a complete pipeline including synthetic data generation and ground-truth data labeling for ear detection in 3D point clouds. The ear detection problem is formulated as a semantic part segmentation problem that detects the ear directly in 3D point clouds of profile face data. We introduce EarNet, a modified version of the PointNet++ architecture, and apply rotation augmentation to handle different pose variations in the real data. We demonstrate that PointNet and PointNet++ cannot manage the rotation of a given object without such augmentation. The synthetic 3D profile face data is generated using statistical shape models. In addition, an automatic tool has been developed and is made publicly available to create ground-truth labels of any 3D public data set that includes co-registered 2D images. The experimental results on the real data demonstrate higher localization as compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches.

KW  - MANIPULATION
AB  - From early ages, we learn to naturally grasp objects from our trial-and-error interaction with the environment. We end up excelling at manipulating objects, such that grabbing a pan by its handle is all but unconscious. However, performing the same task from a machine's perspective is particularly challenging, as it requires an in-depth understanding of object manipulation. We could approximate such an understanding by capturing the hand-object contact resulting from human grasps, i.e., contact maps. This has already been done using cumbersome capture systems, and not on a large scale. In this work, we simplify and accelerate such a process by generating contact maps from our interaction with household objects in photorealistic virtual reality environments. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to generate contact maps at scale from our interaction in a virtual scenario. We train an image-to-image translation method to predict grasp regions on objects, demonstrating the usefulness of our generated contact maps. We provide all the necessary tools, code, and dataset to foster applications where hand-object understanding is necessary.

KW  - EXTRACTION
AB  - The automatic analysis of chemical literature has immense potential to accelerate the discovery of new materials and drugs. Much of the critical information in patent documents and scientific articles is contained in figures, depicting the molecule structures. However, automatically parsing the exact chemical structure is a formidable challenge, due to the amount of detailed information, the diversity of drawing styles, and the need for training data. In this work, we introduce MolGrapher to recognize chemical structures visually. First, a deep keypoint detector detects the atoms. Second, we treat all candidate atoms and bonds as nodes and put them in a graph. This construct allows a natural graph representation of the molecule. Last, we classify atom and bond nodes in the graph with a Graph Neural Network. To address the lack of real training data, we propose a synthetic data generation pipeline producing diverse and realistic results. In addition, we introduce a large-scale benchmark of annotated real molecule images, USPTO-30K, to spur research on this critical topic. Extensive experiments on five datasets show that our approach significantly outperforms classical and learning-based methods in most settings. Code, models, and datasets are available (1).

AB  - Electronic healthcare record data have been used to study risk factors of disease, treatment effectiveness and safety, and to inform healthcare service planning. There has been increasing interest in utilizing these data for new purposes such as for machine learning to develop predictive algorithms to aid diagnostic and treatment decisions. Synthetic data could potentially be an alternative to real-world data for these purposes as well as reveal any biases in the data used for algorithm development. This article discusses the key requirements of synthetic data for multiple purposes and proposes an approach to generate and evaluate synthetic data focused on, but not limited to, cross-sectional healthcare data. To our knowledge, this is the first article to propose a framework to generate and evaluate synthetic healthcare data with the aim of simultaneously preserving the complexities of ground truth data in the synthetic data while also ensuring privacy. We include findings and new insights from synthetic datasets modeled on both the Indian liver patient dataset and UK primary care dataset to demonstrate the application of this framework under different scenarios.

AB  - The availability of hourly wind speed data is becoming increasingly important for ensuring the proper design of wind energy conversion systems. For many sites, measured series of such high resolution are incomplete or entirely lacking; hence the need for a model for synthesizing wind speed data.
   The objective of this paper is to construct a model for synthetically generating hourly wind speed data, adopting a physical-statistical approach. This generation model defines four parameters for characterizing the wind speed time series in terms of probability distribution and autocorrelation functions. As opposed to the numerous methodologies reported in literature, the proposed approach can be adapted to a different number and type of available input data.
   Model validation has been carried out by examining two Italian sites, having different characteristics in terms of mean monthly wind speeds and autocorrelation function. To demonstrate its flexibility, in both sites wind speed time series have been synthesized for three different cases, increasing the amount of known input data. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - For indoor localisation, a challenge in data-driven localisation is to ensure sufficient data to train the prediction model to produce a good accuracy. However, for WiFi-based data collection, human effort is still required to capture a large amount of data as the representation Received Signal Strength (RSS) could easily be affected by obstacles and other factors. In this paper, we propose an extendGAN+ pipeline that leverages up-sampling with the Dirichlet distribution to improve location prediction accuracy with small sample sizes, applies transferred WGAN-GP for synthetic data generation, and ensures data quality with a filtering module. The results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed data augmentation method not only by localisation performance but also showcase the variety of RSS patterns it could produce. Benchmarking against the baseline methods such as fingerprint, random forest, and its base dataset with localisation models, extendGAN+ shows improvements of up to 23.47%, 25.35%, and 18.88% respectively. Furthermore, compared to existing GAN+ methods, it reduces training time by a factor of four due to transfer learning and improves performance by 10.13%.

AB  - Scalable sensor simulation is an important yet challenging open problem for safety-critical domains such as self-driving. Current works in image simulation either fail to be photorealistic or do not model the 3D environment and the dynamic objects within, losing high-level control and physical realism. In this paper, we present GeoSim, a geometry-aware image composition process which synthesizes novel urban driving scenarios by augmenting existing images with dynamic objects extracted from other scenes and rendered at novel poses. Towards this goal, we first build a diverse bank of 3D objects with both realistic geometry and appearance from sensor data. During simulation, we perform a novel geometry-aware simulation-by-composition procedure which 1) proposes plausible and realistic object placements into a given scene, 2) renders novel views of dynamic objects from the asset bank, and 3) composes and blends the rendered image segments. The resulting synthetic images are realistic, traffic-aware, and geometrically consistent, allowing our approach to scale to complex use cases. We demonstrate two such important applications: long-range realistic video simulation across multiple camera sensors, and synthetic data generation for data augmentation on downstream segmentation tasks.

AB  - The generation of synthetic data is becoming a fundamental task in the daily life of any organization due to new protection data laws that are emerging. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and its variants have attracted many researchers in their research work due to its elegant theoretical basis and its great performance in the generation of new data [19]. The goal of synthetic data generation is to create data that will perform similarly to the original dataset for many analysis tasks, such as classification. The problem of GANs is that in a classification problem, GANs do not take class labels into account when generating new data, they treat it as another attribute. This research work has focused on the creation of new synthetic data from the "Default of Credit Card Clients" dataset with a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN). CGANs are an extension of GANs where the class label is taken into account when the new data is generated. The performance of our results has been measured by comparing the results obtained with classification algorithms, both in the original dataset and in the data generated.

KW  - CLASSIFICATION
AB  - In imbalanced data classification, training classification model with synthetic samples can effectively improve the performance in mining minority samples. However, the majority samples are more likely to produce noise samples than the minority. The noise samples of the majority will affect the data generation algorithm, and it's difficult to generate the synthetic boundary data for the minority. A boundary synthetic data generation algorithm called CCR-GSVM is proposed based on Combined Cleaning and Resampling(CCR) and Granular Support Vector Machine(GSVM-RU) in this paper. CCR-GSVM combines the boundary information of SVM and GSVM-RU to filter the noise samples of the majority, so as to use more effective majority samples generate synthetic data by CCR. The synthetic samples located in the margin boundary are obtain if the classification performance is improved. The comparative experiments on 12 imbalanced datasets shows that the boundary data generated by CCR-GSVM can help support vector machine with effect on improving the F1-measure and G-mean under the situation of majority noise, which shows the CCR-GSVM has a better effectiveness to generate synthetic boundary samples.

TI  - Analyzing Data-Centric Properties for Graph Contrastive Learning
T2  - ADVANCES IN NEURAL INFORMATION PROCESSING SYSTEMS 35 (NEURIPS 2022)
LA  - English
CP  - 36th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS)
AB  - Recent analyses of self-supervised learning (SSL) find the following data-centric properties to be critical for learning good representations: invariance to task-irrelevant semantics, separability of classes in some latent space, and recoverability of labels from augmented samples. However, given their discrete, non-Euclidean nature, graph datasets and graph SSL methods are unlikely to satisfy these properties. This raises the question: how do graph SSL methods, such as contrastive learning (CL), work well? To systematically probe this question, we perform a generalization analysis for CL when using generic graph augmentations (GGAs), with a focus on data-centric properties. Our analysis yields formal insights into the limitations of GGAs and the necessity of task-relevant augmentations. As we empirically show, GGAs do not induce task-relevant invariances on common benchmark datasets, leading to only marginal gains over naive, untrained baselines. Our theory motivates a synthetic data generation process that enables control over task-relevant information and boasts pre-defined optimal augmentations. This flexible benchmark helps us identify yet unrecognized limitations in advanced augmentation techniques (e.g., automated methods).

AB  - Data scarcity is a significant problem when it comes to designing machine learning systems for structural health monitoring applications, especially those based around data-hungry algorithms and methods, such as deep learning. Synthetic data generation could potentially alleviate this problem, lowering the number of measurements that need to be acquired in slow and often expensive conventional experiments. Such synthesis can be done by Generative Adversarial Networks, potentially creating unlimited synthetic samples recreating the original data distribution. While most of the research about these networks is centered around using them on image data, they have also been applied to audio waves - going as far as successfully synthesizing human speech. This suggests that these networks should also apply to synthesizing time-domain signals in various fields of structural health monitoring, guided waves in particular, as they are in many ways similar to audio wave signals. This work proposes an adaptation of style-based GAN architecture to time-domain signal generation, and presents its viability for guided waves synthesis, utilizing a database of signals collected in series of pitch-catch experiments on a composite plate.

AB  - In this paper a vision-based system for cyclist detection for highly automated vehicles is presented which utilize a deep convolutional neural network. Given the limited amount of LiDAR data for cyclists for the task of cyclist detection, a realistic synthetic data generation pipeline has been adopted in this work to overcome this problem by generate virtually unlimited number of synthetic training, testing and validation depth image datasets of cyclists. Then, using a holistic detection technique, any instances of cyclists can be localised in the generated synthetic depth images which can be shown as a down-sampled instances of 3D LiDAR data. The proposed technique in this paper, exploits the Faster Region-based Convolutional Network (Faster R-CNN) architecture for simultaneously detecting and localising any instances of cyclists in depth images. The trained Faster R-CNN models have been tested on the widely popular KITTI urban dataset and the results show that the proposed framework outperforms the classical HOG+SVM object localisation method with increased 21% in average precision. This shows the ability of the trained models using the proposed framework to generalise from synthetic training dataset to operate on live dataset.

AB  - Time series data are widely used and provide a wealth of information for countless applications. However, some applications are faced with a limited amount of data, or the data cannot be used due to confidentiality concerns. To overcome these obstacles, time series can be generated synthetically. For example, electrocardiograms can be synthesized to make them available for building models to predict conditions such as cardiac arrhythmia without leaking patient information. Although many different approaches to time series synthesis have been proposed, evaluating the quality of synthetic time series data poses unique challenges and remains an open problem, as there is a lack of a clear definition of what constitutes a "good" synthesis. To this end, we present a comprehensive literature survey to identify different aspects of synthesis quality and their relationships. Based on this, we propose a definition of synthesis quality and a systematic evaluation procedure for assessing it. With this work, we aim to provide a common language and criteria for evaluating synthetic time series data. Our goal is to promote more rigorous and reproducible research in time series synthesis by enabling researchers and practitioners to generate high-quality synthetic time series data.

KW  - HISTOPATHOLOGY
AB  - The success of training computer-vision models heavily relies on the support of large-scale, real-world images with annotations. Yet such an annotation-ready dataset is difficult to curate in pathology due to the privacy protection and excessive annotation burden. To aid in computational pathology, synthetic data generation, curation, and annotation present a cost-effective means to quickly enable data diversity that is required to boost model performance at different stages. In this study, we introduce a large-scale synthetic pathological image dataset paired with the annotation for nuclei semantic segmentation, termed as Synthetic Nuclei and annOtation Wizard (SNOW). The proposed SNOW is developed via a standardized workflow by applying the off-the-shelf image generator and nuclei annotator. The dataset contains overall 20k image tiles and 1,448,522 annotated nuclei with the CC-BY license. We show that SNOW can be used in both supervised and semi-supervised training scenarios. Extensive results suggest that synthetic-data-trained models are competitive under a variety of model training settings, expanding the scope of better using synthetic images for enhancing downstream data-driven clinical tasks.

AB  - City-scale spatiotemporal mobile network traffic data can support numerous applications in and beyond networking. However, operators are very reluctant to share their data, which is curbing innovation and research reproducibility. To remedy this status quo, we propose SpectraGAN, a novel deep generative model that, upon training with real-world network traffic measurements, can produce high-fidelity synthetic mobile traffic data for new, arbitrary sized geographical regions over long periods. To this end, the model only requires publicly available context information about the target region, such as population census data. SpectraGAN is an original conditional GAN design with the defining feature of generating spectra of mobile traffic at all locations of the target region based on their contextual features. Evaluations with mobile traffic measurement datasets collected by different operators in 13 cities across two European countries demonstrate that SpectraGAN can synthesize more dependable traffic than a range of representative baselines from the literature. We also show that synthetic data generated with SpectraGAN yield similar results to that with real data when used in applications like radio access network infrastructure power savings and resource allocation, or dynamic population mapping.

AB  - PurposeComputer-assisted surgical systems provide support information to the surgeon, which can improve the execution and overall outcome of the procedure. These systems are based on deep learning models that are trained on complex and challenging-to-annotate data. Generating synthetic data can overcome these limitations, but it is necessary to reduce the domain gap between real and synthetic data.MethodsWe propose a method for image-to-image translation based on a Stable Diffusion model, which generates realistic images starting from synthetic data. Compared to previous works, the proposed method is better suited for clinical application as it requires a much smaller amount of input data and allows finer control over the generation of details by introducing different variants of supporting control networks.ResultsThe proposed method is applied in the context of laparoscopic cholecystectomy, using synthetic and real data from public datasets. It achieves a mean Intersection over Union of 69.76%, significantly improving the baseline results (69.76 vs. 42.21%).ConclusionsThe proposed method for translating synthetic images into images with realistic characteristics will enable the training of deep learning methods that can generalize optimally to real-world contexts, thereby improving computer-assisted intervention guidance systems.

AB  - Breast cancer is the second most common cancer worldwide, primarily affecting women, while histopathological image analysis is one of the possibile methods used to determine tumor malignancy. Regarding image analysis, the application of deep learning has become increasingly prevalent in recent years. However, a significant issue is the unbalanced nature of available datasets, with some classes having more images than others, which may impact the performance of the models due to poorer generalizability. A possible strategy to avoid this problem is downsampling the class with the most images to create a balanced dataset. Nevertheless, this approach is not recommended for small datasets as it can lead to poor model performance. Instead, techniques such as data augmentation are traditionally used to address this issue. These techniques apply simple transformations such as translation or rotation to the images to increase variability in the dataset. Another possibility is using generative adversarial networks (GANs), which can generate images from a relatively small training set. This work aims to enhance model performance in classifying histopathological images by applying data augmentation using GANs instead of traditional techniques.

AB  - Federated learning is a novel distribute machine learning paradigm to support cooperative model training among multiple participant clients, where each client keeps its private data locally to protect its data privacy. However, in practical application domains, Federated learning still meets several heterogeneous challenges such data heterogeneity, model heterogeneity, and computation heterogeneity, significantly decreasing its global model performance. To the best of our knowledge, existing solutions only focus on one or two challenges in their heterogeneous settings. In this paper, to address the above challenges simultaneously, we present a novel solution called Full Heterogeneous Federated Learning (FHFL). Firstly, we propose a synthetic data generation approach to mitigate the Non-IID data heterogeneity problem. Secondly, we use knowledge distillation to learn from heterogeneous models of participant clients for model aggregation in the central server. Finally, we produce an opportunistic computation schedule strategy to exploit the idle computation resources for fast-computing clients. Experiment results on different datasets show that our FHFL method can achieve an excellent model training performance. We believe it will serve as a pioneer work for distributed model training among heterogeneous clients in Federated learning.

AB  - Situation Awareness in health care involves two different sets of concerns that are only exacerbated in a pandemic. First is the societal: who is exposed, who is infected, when and how they interact with others, and how can we reduce the severity of impact (epidemiological). Second is the personal: what happens or will happen to each person, and how we can improve that result (individual). This paper is about the latter.
   It describes an approach to building and maintaining models of disease progression using advanced mathematical methods. These models will be tuned to individual patients, based on the existing and arriving measurement data, as the disease is progressing. The initial models will be generic representations, based on medical expertise, of the current understanding of the various ways the disease can progress. The models will be changed, adjusted separately for each individual patient, according to the newly arriving measurements.
   This paper describes the technical approach, the purpose and style of modeling we propose, and what we can expect to learn from the application of these methods. The target disease for these first experiments is COVID-19.

AB  - Two key questions in cardiac image analysis are to assess the anatomy and motion of the heart from images; and to understand how they are associated with non-imaging clinical factors such as gender, age and diseases. While the first question can often be addressed by image segmentation and motion tracking algorithms, our capability to model and answer the second question is still limited. In this work, we propose a novel conditional generative model to describe the 4D spatio-temporal anatomy of the heart and its interaction with non-imaging clinical factors. The clinical factors are integrated as the conditions of the generative modelling, which allows us to investigate how these factors influence the cardiac anatomy. We evaluate the model performance in mainly two tasks, anatomical sequence completion and sequence generation. The model achieves high performance in anatomical sequence completion, comparable to or outperforming other state-of-the-art generative models. In terms of sequence generation, given clinical conditions, the model can generate realistic synthetic 4D sequential anatomies that share similar distributions with the real data.

AB  - A century-long debate on bodily states and emotions persists. While the involvement of bodily activity in emotion physiology is widely recognized, the specificity and causal role of such activity related to brain dynamics has not yet been demonstrated. We hypothesize that the peripheral neural control on cardiovascular activity prompts and sustains brain dynamics during an emotional experience, so these afferent inputs are processed by the brain by triggering a concurrent efferent information transfer to the body. To this end, we investigated the functional brain-heart interplay under emotion elicitation in publicly available data from 62 healthy subjects using a computational model based on synthetic data generation of electroencephalography and electrocardiography signals. Our findings show that sympathovagal activity plays a leading and causal role in initiating the emotional response, in which ascending modulations from vagal activity precede neural dynamics and correlate to the reported level of arousal. The subsequent dynamic interplay observed between the central and autonomic nervous systems sustains the processing of emotional arousal. These findings should be particularly revealing for the psychophysiology and neuroscience of emotions.

AB  - In crack detection, pixel-accurate predictions are necessary to measure the width - an important indicator of the severity of a crack. However, manual annotation of images to train supervised models is a hard and time-consuming task. Because of this, manual annotations tend to be inaccurate, particularly at pixel-accurate level. The learning bias introduced by this inaccuracy hinders pixel-accurate crack detection. In this paper we propose a novel tool aimed for synthetic image generation with accurate crack labels - Syncrack. This parametrizable tool also provides a method to introduce controlled noise to annotations, emulating human inaccuracy. By using this, first we do a robustness study of the impact of training with inaccurate labels. This study quantifies the detrimental effect of inaccurate annotations in the final prediction scores. Afterwards, we propose to use Syncrack to avoid this detrimental effect in a real-life context. For this, we show the advantages of using Syncrack generated images with accurate annotations for crack detection on real road images. Since supervised scores are biased by the inaccuracy of annotations, we propose a set of unsupervised metric to evaluate the segmentation quality in terms of crack width.

AB  - Development of computer vision algorithms using convolutional neural networks and deep learning has necessitated ever greater amounts of annotated and labelled data to produce high performance models. Large, public data sets have been instrumental in pushing forward computer vision by providing the data necessary for training. However, many computer vision applications cannot rely on general image data provided in the available public datasets to train models, instead requiring labelled image data that is not readily available in the public domain on a large scale. At the same time, acquiring such data from the real world can be difficult, costly to obtain, and manual labour intensive to label in large quantities. Because of this, synthetic image data has been pushed to the forefront as a potentially faster and cheaper alternative to collecting and annotating real data. This review provides general overview of types of synthetic image data, as categorised by synthesised output, common methods of synthesising different types of image data, existing applications and logical extensions, performance of synthetic image data in different applications and the associated difficulties in assessing data performance, and areas for further research.

AB  - RF sensors have been recently proposed as a new modality for sign language processing technology. They are noncontact, effective in the dark, and acquire a direct measurement of signing kinematic via exploitation of the micro-Doppler effect. First, this work provides an in depth comparative examination of the kinematic properties of signing as measured by RF sensors for both fluent ASL users and hearing imitation signers. Second, as ASL recognition techniques utilizing deep learning requires a large amount of training data, this work examines the effect of signing kinematics and subject fluency on adversarial learning techniques for data synthesis. The following two different approaches for the synthetic training data generation are proposed: 1) adversarial domain adaptation to minimize the differences between imitation signing and fluent signing data and 2) kinematically-constrained generative adversarial networks for accurate synthesis of RF signing signatures. The results show that the kinematic discrepancies between imitation signing and fluent signing are so significant that training on data directly synthesized from fluent RF signers offers greater performance (93% top-5 accuracy) than that produced by adaptation of imitation signing (88% top-5 accuracy) when classifying 100 ASL signs.

AB  - The increased adoption of lithium-iron-phosphate batteries, in response to the need to reduce the battery manufacturing process's dependence on scarce minerals and create a resilient and ethical supply chain, comes with many challenges. The design of an effective and high-performing battery management system (BMS) for such technology is one of those challenges. In this work, a physics-based model describing the two-phase transition operation of an iron-phosphate positive electrode-in a graphite anode battery-is integrated with a machine-learning model to capture the hysteresis and path-dependent behavior during transient operation. The machine-learning component of the proposed "hybrid" model is built upon the knowledge of the electrochemical internal states of the battery during charge and discharge operation over several driving profiles. The hybrid model is experimentally validated over 15 h of driving, and it is shown that the machine-learning component is responsible for a small percentage of the total battery behavior (i.e., it compensates for voltage hysteresis). The proposed modeling strategy can be used for battery performance analysis, synthetic data generation, and the development of reduced-order models for BMS design.

AB  - Hybrid energy systems consisting of multiple energy inputs and multiple energy outputs have been proposed to be an effective element to enable ever increasing penetration of clean energy. In order to better understand the dynamic and probabilistic behavior of hybrid energy systems, this paper proposes a model combining Fourier series and autoregressive moving average (ARMA) to characterize historical weather measurements and to generate synthetic weather (e.g., wind speed) data. In particular, Fourier series is used to characterize the seasonal trend in historical data, while ARMA is applied to capture the autocorrelation in residue time series (e.g., measurements with seasonal trends subtracted). The generated synthetic wind speed data is then utilized to perform probabilistic analysis of a particular hybrid energy system configuration, which consists of nuclear power plant, wind farm, battery storage, natural gas boiler, and chemical plant. Requirements on component ramping rate, economic and environmental impacts of hybrid energy systems, and the effects of deploying different sizes of batteries in smoothing renewable variability, are all investigated.

AB  - Crowdsourcing has proven to be a cost-effective way to meet the demands for labeled training data in supervised deep learning models. However, crowdsourced labels are often inconsistent and noisy due to cognitive and expertise differences among crowd workers. Existing approaches either infer latent true labels from noisy crowdsourced labels or learn a discriminative model directly from the crowdsourced labeled data, assuming the latent true label distribution is class-balanced. Unfortunately, in many real-world applications, the true label distribution typically is imbalanced across classes. Therefore, in this paper, we address the problem of learning from crowdsourced labeled data with an imbalanced true label distribution. We propose a new framework, named Learning from Imbalanced Crowdsourced Labeled Data" (ICED), which simultaneously infers true labels from imbalanced crowdsourced labeled data and achieves high accuracy on downstream tasks such as classification. The ICED framework consists of two modules, i.e., a true label inference module and a synthetic data generation module, that augment each other iteratively. Extensive experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the ICED framework. Our code is available at https://github.com/wentao-repo/ICED.

AB  - We present an approach for on-line recognition of handwritten math symbols using adaptations of off-line features and synthetic data generation. We compare the performance of our approach using four different classification methods: AdaBoost.M1 with C4.5 decision trees, Random Forests and Support-Vector Machines with linear and Gaussian kernels. Despite the fact that timing information can be extracted from on-line data, our feature set is based on shape description for greater tolerance to variations of the drawing process. Our main datasets come from the Competition on Recognition of Online Handwritten Mathematical Expressions (CROHME) 2012 and 2013. Class representation bias in CROHME datasets is mitigated by generating samples for underrepresented classes using an elastic distortion model. Our results show that generation of synthetic data for underrepresented classes might lead to improvements of the average per-class accuracy. We also tested our system using the MathBrush dataset achieving a top-1 accuracy of 89.87% which is comparable with the best results of other recently published approaches on the same dataset.

AB  - In the age of machine learning, data-driven approaches with hybrid data (a mixture of real images and simulation images) are getting increasingly popular. One major issue with creating a realistic simulation for surface engineering is that the surface of the mesh model used in the simulation is smooth. Often, this mesh does not contain information on surface texture; thus, simulating an object based on these meshes may not represent an actual surface texture of a real component. This article presents a novel technique for introducing surface roughness onto a smooth mesh object to facilitate engineering simulation by using a conditional Generative-Adversarial Network (cGAN) that is trained on real height maps to generate random 2D height maps that represents a realistic texture of a typical upskin and downskin surface of an additively manufactured (AM) part. This approach extracted the past scans of AM components from the Focus Variation microscopy. The 3D surface deviation is extracted as height maps and used as the training data for the generative network. This paper will also discuss the structural similarities between the synthetic and real data using standard descriptors for surface texture characterisation, such as S-a, S-q and S-dq.

AB  - Handwritten Text Recognition has achieved an impressive performance in public benchmarks. However, due to the high inter- and intra-class variability between handwriting styles, such recognizers need to be trained using huge volumes of manually labeled training data. To alleviate this labor-consuming problem, synthetic data produced with TrueType fonts has been often used in the training loop to gain volume and augment the handwriting style variability. However, there is a significant style bias between synthetic and real data which hinders the improvement of recognition performance. To deal with such limitations, we propose a generative method for handwritten text-line images, which is conditioned on both visual appearance and textual content. Our method is able to produce long text-line samples with diverse handwriting styles. Once properly trained, our method can also be adapted to new target data by only accessing unlabeled text-line images to mimic handwritten styles and produce images with any textual content. Extensive experiments have been done on making use of the generated samples to boost Handwritten Text Recognition performance. Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the current state of the art.

TI  - CAD2Render: A Modular Toolkit for GPU-accelerated Photorealistic Synthetic Data Generation for the Manufacturing Industry
T2  - 2023 IEEE/CVF WINTER CONFERENCE ON APPLICATIONS OF COMPUTER VISION WORKSHOPS (WACVW)

CP  - 23rd IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV)
AB  - The use of computer vision for product and assembly quality control is becoming ubiquitous in the manufacturing industry. Lately, it is apparent that machine learning based solutions are outperforming classical computer vision algorithms in terms of performance and robustness. However, a main drawback is that they require sufficiently large and labeled training datasets, which are often not available or too tedious and too time consuming to acquire. This is especially true for low-volume and high-variance manufacturing. Fortunately, in this industry, CAD models of the manufactured or assembled products are available. This paper introduces CAD2Render, a GPU-accelerated synthetic data generator based on the Unity High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP). CAD2Render is designed to add variations in a modular fashion, making it possible for high customizable data generation, tailored to the needs of the industrial use case at hand. Although CAD2Render is specifically designed for manufacturing use cases, it can be used for other domains as well. We validate CAD2Render by demonstrating state of the art performance in two industrial relevant setups. We demonstrate that the data generated by our approach can be used to train object detection and pose estimation models with a high enough accuracy to direct a robot. The code for CAD2Render is available at https://github.com/EDM-Research/CAD2Render.

TI  - RLIP: Relational Language-Image Pre-training for Human-Object Interaction Detection
T2  - ADVANCES IN NEURAL INFORMATION PROCESSING SYSTEMS 35 (NEURIPS 2022)
LA  - English
CP  - 36th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS)
AB  - The task of Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection targets fine-grained visual parsing of humans interacting with their environment, enabling a broad range of applications. Prior work has demonstrated the benefits of effective architecture design and integration of relevant cues for more accurate HOI detection. However, the design of an appropriate pre-training strategy for this task remains underexplored by existing approaches. To address this gap, we propose Relational Language-Image Pre-training (RLIP), a strategy for contrastive pre-training that leverages both entity and relation descriptions. To make effective use of such pre-training, we make three technical contributions: (1) a new Parallel entity detection and Sequential relation inference (ParSe) architecture that enables the use of both entity and relation descriptions during holistically optimized pre-training; (2) a synthetic data generation framework, Label Sequence Extension, that expands the scale of language data available within each minibatch; (3) mechanisms to account for ambiguity, Relation Quality Labels and Relation Pseudo-Labels, to mitigate the influence of ambiguous/noisy samples in the pre-training data. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the benefits of these contributions, collectively termed RLIP-ParSe, for improved zero-shot, few-shot and fine-tuning HOI detection performance as well as increased robustness to learning from noisy annotations. Code will be available at https://github.com/JacobYuan7/RLIP.

AB  - Data driven prognostic models are becoming more prevalent in many areas, ranging from heavy trucks to gas turbines. One aspect of certain prognostic models is the need for labeled failures, which then can be used as positive examples, when modelling the prognostic problem. Unfortunately, standard algorithms for creating prognostic models can suffer when labeled data is unbalanced, w.r.t. class distribution, leading to prognostic models with poor performance. In this paper we present a methodology for creating synthetic data that can be used to augment the underrepresented class and hence dramatically increase performance of the data driven predictive model. In our study we utilize data collected from heavy trucks and focus on predicting failure of one engine component that is crucial for the operation of heavy trucks. We examine different way of generating synthetic examples in a low dimensional setting, it is found that three methods out of the six methods studied does not improve performance compared to using only the original data. The other three methods based on interpolation is superior to only using the original data, with SMOTE outperforming the two other interpolation methods. SMOTE lowers the estimated cost on test data, compared to using a model trained on the original data set only, with 67%.

AB  - In Industry 5.0, the scarcity of data on defective components in smart manufacturing leads to imbalanced data sets. This imbalance poses a significant challenge to the develop ment of robust Machine Learning (ML) models, which typically require a rich variety of data for effective training. The imbal ance not only restricts the models' accuracy but also their ap plicability in diverse industrial scenarios. To tackle this issue, our research delves into the capabilities of Deep Generative Models, with a special focus on Generative Adversarial Networks, for the generation of synthetic data. This approach is aimed at rectify ing dataset imbalances, thereby enhancing the training process of ML models. We demonstrate how synthetic data can substan tially bolster the performance and reliability of ML models in industrial settings. Furthermore, the paper presents an innova tive MLOps pipeline and architecture, meticulously designed to incorporate Deep Generative Models (DGMs) into the entire ML development cycle. This solution is automated and goes beyond mere automation; it is self-optimizing and capable of making necessary corrections, specifically engineered to address the dual challenges of data imbalance and scarcity, thus enabling more precise and dependable ML applications in smart manufacturing.

AB  - Skin cancer is a major public health problem that could benefit from computer-aided diagnosis to reduce the burden of this common disease. Skin lesion segmentation from images is an important step toward achieving this goal. However, the presence of natural and artificial artifacts (e.g., hair and air bubbles), intrinsic factors (e.g., lesion shape and contrast), and variations in image acquisition conditions make skin lesion segmentation a challenging task. Recently, various researchers have explored the applicability of deep learning models to skin lesion segmentation. In this survey, we cross-examine 177 research papers that deal with deep learning-based segmentation of skin lesions. We analyze these works along several dimensions, including input data (datasets, preprocessing, and synthetic data generation), model design (architecture, modules, and losses), and evaluation aspects (data annotation requirements and segmentation performance). We discuss these dimensions both from the viewpoint of select seminal works, and from a systematic viewpoint, examining how those choices have influenced current trends, and how their limitations should be addressed. To facilitate comparisons, we summarize all examined works in a comprehensive table as well as an interactive table available online1.

AB  - This paper presents a novel approach to create synthetic dataset for word recognition systems. Our purpose is to improve performance of off-line handwritten text recognizers by providing it with additional synthetic training data. Due to lack of proper data-set for many languages it becomes hard to train recognition systems. To solve such problems synthetic handwriting could be used to expand the existing training dataset. Any available digital data from online newspaper and such sources can be used to generate this synthetic data. The digital data is distorted in such a way that the underlying pattern is conserved for identification of the word by both machine and human user. The images hence produced can be used to train any classification system for handwriting recognition. This data can be used independently to train the system or be combined with natural handwritten data to augment the original dataset and improve the accuracy of the results. We experimented using only synthetic data obtaining high recognition accuracy in both character and word recognition. The data was tested on 3 Indian scripts for numerals- Hindi, Bengali and Telugu, and 1 script-Hindi for words, the results achieved hence are highly promising.

AB  - Recent years have witnessed an increasing demand for extensive data sets to power various artificial intelligence (AI) methods, including machine learning (ML) and deep learning. Collecting real-world data, however, faces challenges like sensitivity concerns, high costs, and extensive processing times. Consequently, ML/AI models trained on limited data often suffer from implicit bias and reduced performance due to their inability to generalize effectively. Addressing these issues necessitates large, meticulously annotated data sets rich in diverse examples to counteract bias and enhance model performance. Nonetheless, compiling and labeling such vast data sets, potentially consisting of millions of items, is a labor-intensive and often exorbitantly costly process. In response to this challenge, the research discussed here explores expanding a deep learning framework to create customizable synthetic data, employing Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The proposed VAE framework is designed to digitally generate data as needed, conforming to user-defined specifications. This approach, with its wide-ranging and generalized capabilities, addresses the gap in customized, synthetic data generation, where previous efforts were confined to specific areas. Our framework leverages the manipulation of latent space distributions in VAEs to produce the required synthetic data. This serves as an augmentation to existing real datasets, significantly broadening the available training data for ML and deep learning applications.

AB  - Recent work has shown significant progress in the direction of synthetic data generation using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). GANs have been applied in many fields of computer vision including text-to-image conversion, domain transfer, super-resolution, and image-to-video applications. In computer vision, traditional GANs are based on deep convolutional neural networks. However, deep convolutional neural networks can require extensive computational resources because they are based on multiple operations performed by convolutional layers, which can consist of millions of trainable parameters. Training a GAN model can be difficult and it takes a significant amount of time to reach an equilibrium point. In this paper, we investigate the use of depthwise separable convolutions to reduce training time while maintaining data generation performance. Our results show that a DepthwiseGAN architecture can generate realistic images in shorter training periods when compared to a StarGan architecture, but that model capacity still plays a significant role in generative modelling. In addition, we show that depthwise separable convolutions perform best when only applied to the generator. For quality evaluation of generated images, we use the Frechet Inception Distance (FID), which compares the similarity between the generated image distribution and that of the training dataset.

AB  - The Layout Analysis (LA) stage is of vital importance to the correct performance of an Optical Music Recognition (OMR) system. It identifies the regions of interest, such as staves or lyrics, which must then be processed in order to transcribe their content. Despite the existence of modern approaches based on deep learning, an exhaustive study of LA in OMR has not yet been carried out with regard to the performance of different models, their generalization to different domains or, more importantly, their impact on subsequent stages of the pipeline. This work focuses on filling this gap in the literature by means of an experimental study of different neural architectures, music document types, and evaluation scenarios. The need for training data has also led to a proposal for a new semi-synthetic data-generation technique that enables the efficient applicability of LA approaches in real scenarios. Our results show that: (i) the choice of the model and its performance are crucial for the entire transcription process; (ii) the metrics commonly used to evaluate the LA stage do not always correlate with the final performance of the OMR system, and (iii) the proposed data-generation technique enables state-of-the-art results to be achieved with a limited set of labeled data.

AB  - We address the problem of image feature learning for scene text recognition. The image features in the state-of-the-art methods are learned from large-scale synthetic image datasets. However, most methods only rely on outputs of the synthetic data generation process, namely realistically looking images, and completely ignore the rest of the process. We propose to leverage the parameters that lead to the output images to improve image feature learning. Specifically, for every image out of the data generation process, we obtain the associated parameters and render another "clean" image that is free of select distortion factors that are applied to the output image. Because of the absence of distortion factors, the clean image tends to be easier to recognize than the original image which can serve as supervision. We design a multi-task network with an encoder-discriminator-generator architecture to guide the feature of the original image toward that of the clean image. The experiments show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on standard scene text recognition benchmarks in the lexicon-free category. Furthermore, we show that without explicit handling, our method works on challenging cases where input images contain severe geometric distortion, such as text on a curved path.

AB  - Ultrasonic imaging is widely used for non-destructive evaluation in various industry applications. Early detection of defects in materials is the key to keeping the integrity of inspected structures. Currently, there have been some attempts to develop models for automated defect detection on ultrasonic data. To push the performance of these models even further more data is needed to train deep convolutional neural networks. A lot of data is also needed for training human experts. However, gathering a sufficient amount of data for training is a challenge due to the rare occurrence of defects in real inspection scenarios. This is why inspection results heavily depend on the inspector's previous experience. To overcome these challenges, we propose the use of Generative Adversarial Networks for generating realistic ultrasonic images. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first one to show that a Generative Adversarial Network is able to generate images indistinguishable from real ultrasonic images. The most thorough statistical quality analysis to date of generated ultrasonic images has been conducted with the participation of human expert inspectors. The experimental results show that images generated using our Generative Adversarial Network provide the highest quality images compared to other published methods.

AB  - Distributed machine learning has attracted much attention in the last decade with the widespread use of the Internet of Things. As a generative model, Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) has excellent empir-ical performance. However, the distributed storage of data and the fact that data cannot be shared for pri-vacy reasons in a federated learning setting bring new challenges to training GAN. To address this issue, we propose private FL-GAN, a differentially private GAN based on federated learning. By strategically combining the Lipschitz condition with differential privacy sensitivity, our model can generate high-quality synthetic data without sacrificing the training data's privacy. When communication between cli-ents becomes the main bottleneck for federated learning, we propose to use a serialized model-training paradigm, which significantly reduces communication costs. Considering the distributed data is often non-IID in reality, which poses challenges to modeling, we further propose universal private FL-GAN to approach this problem. We not only theoretically prove that our algorithms can provide strict privacy guarantees with differential privacy, but also experimentally demonstrate that our models can generate satisfactory data while protecting the privacy of the training data, even if the data is non-IID.

AB  - Computer vision (CV) algorithms have improved tremendously with the application of neural network-based approaches. For instance, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) achieve state of the art performance on Infrared (IR) detection and identification (e.g., classification) problems. To train such algorithms, however, requires a tremendous quantity of labeled data, which are less available in the IR domain than for "natural imagery", and are further less available for CV-related tasks. Recent work has demonstrated that synthetic data generation techniques provide a cheap and attractive alternative to collecting real data, despite a "realism gap" that exists between synthetic and real IR data.
   In this work, we train deep models on a combination of real and synthetic IR data, and we evaluate model performance on real IR data. We focus on the tasks of vehicle and person detection, object identification, and vehicle parts segmentation. We find that for both detection and object identification, training on a combination of real and synthetic data performs better than training only on real data. This classification improvement demonstrates an advantage to using synthetic data for computer vision. Furthermore, we believe that the utility of synthetic data - when combined with real data - will only increase as the realism gap closes.

AB  - Underwater imaging is being extensively used for monitoring the abundance of lobster species and their biodiversity in their local habitats. However, manual assessment of these images requires a huge amount of human effort. In this article, we propose to automate the process of lobster detection using a deep learning technique. A major obstacle in deploying such an automatic framework for the localization of lobsters in diverse environments is the lack of large annotated training datasets. Generating synthetic datasets to train these object detection models has become a popular approach. However, the current synthetic data generation frameworks rely on automatic segmentation of objects of interest, which becomes difficult when the objects have a complex shape, such as lobster. To overcome this limitation, we propose an approach to synthetically generate parts of the lobster. To handle the variability of real-world images, these parts were inserted into a set of diverse background marine images to generate a large synthetic dataset. A state-of-the-art object detector was trained using this synthetic parts dataset and tested on the challenging task of Western rock lobster detection in West Australian seas. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first automatic lobster detection technique for partially visible and occluded lobsters.

AB  - A significant volume of analog information, i.e., documents and images, have been digitized in the form of scanned copies for storing, sharing, and/or analyzing in the digital world. However, the quality of such contents is severely degraded by various distortions caused by printing, storing, and scanning processes in the physical world. Although restoring high-quality content from scanned copies has become an indispensable task for many products, it has not been systematically explored, and to the best of our knowledge, no public datasets are available. In this paper, we define this problem as Descanning and introduce a new high-quality and large-scale dataset named DESCAN-18K. It contains 18K pairs of original and scanned images collected in the wild containing multiple complex degradations. In order to eliminate such complex degradations, we propose a new image restoration model called DescanDiffusion consisting of a color encoder that corrects the global color degradation and a conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) that removes local degradations. To further improve the generalization ability of DescanDiffusion, we also design a synthetic data generation scheme by reproducing prominent degradations in scanned images. We demonstrate that our DescanDiffusion outperforms other baselines including commercial restoration products, objectively and subjectively, via comprehensive experiments and analyses.

LA  - English
CP  - IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)
AB  - Despite the tremendous progress on data-free knowledge distillation (DFKD) based on synthetic data generation, there are still limitations in diverse and efficient data synthesis. It is naive to expect that a simple combination of generative network-based data synthesis and data augmentation will solve these issues. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel data-free knowledge distillation method (SpaceshipNet) based on channel-wise feature exchange (CFE) and multi-scale spatial activation region consistency (mSARC) constraint. Specifically, CFE allows our generative network to better sample from the feature space and efficiently synthesize diverse images for learning the student network. However, using CFE alone can severely amplify the unwanted noises in the synthesized images, which may result in failure to improve distillation learning and even have negative effects. Therefore, we propose mSARC to assure the student network can imitate not only the logit output but also the spatial activation region of the teacher network in order to alleviate the influence of unwanted noises in diverse synthetic images on distillation learning. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet, Imagenette, and ImageNet100 show that our method can work well with different backbone networks, and outperform the state-of-the-art DFKD methods.

AB  - Data plenitude is the bottleneck for data-driven approaches, including neural networks. In particular, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) require an abundant database of training images to achieve a desired high accuracy. Current techniques employed for boosting small datasets are data augmentation and synthetic data generation, which suffer from computational complexity and imprecision compared to original datasets. In this paper, we intercalate prior knowledge based on spatial relation between images in the third dimension by computing the gradient of subsequent images in the dataset to remove extraneous information and highlight subtle variations between images. The approach is coined "Inverted Cone" because the volume of brain images below the level of the eyes is ordered to form an inverted cone geometry.
   The application explored in this work is deboning, or brain extraction, in brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The difficulty of obtaining ground truth for this application prevents the ability of obtaining a large quantity of training images to train the CNN. We considered a limited dataset of 23 patients with and without malignant glioblastoma. Deboning was performed by employing an optimized CNN architecture with and without the Inverted Cone processing. The classic CNN without prior knowledge achieved a validation accuracy of 77%, while the Inverted Cone CNN model achieved a validation accuracy of 86% in a dataset of 451 brain MRI slices.

AB  - Testing data-mining tools during their development, or comparing the accuracy of alternative tools designed to achieve the same goal, requires having instances of the data sets on which the tools will operate. The diverse and massive nature of input data sets limits the practicality of obtaining test data sets through statistical sampling, and accessibility to public data sets is often limited as a result of proprietary and privacy rights that protect many sources of data. A natural alternative to obtaining actual data sets is to generate synthetic data sets. Usually partial information about associations between attributes on the data set will be available. This paper addresses the problem of how to integrate all the partial information into a non-parametric synthetic data generation scheme. The goal is to devise a scheme that incorporates all the information that can be found about associations between attributes, but not to force additional structure (e.g. distribution assumptions) into the scheme. The key to the scheme is a classic algorithm from statistics, the iterative proportional-fitting algorithm, which is well known for facilitating the analysis of contingency table data. In this paper, we show how it can be used to achieve our stated goal.

AB  - This paper presents an end-to-end model of Deep Convolutional Recurrent Network (DCRN) for recognizing offline handwritten Japanese text lines. The end-to-end DCRN model has three parts: a convolutional feature extractor using Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) to extract a feature sequence from a text line image; recurrent layers employing a Deep Bidirectional LSTM to predict pre-frame from the feature sequence; and a transcription layer using Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) to convert the pre-frame predictions into the label sequence. Since our end-to-end model requires a large data for training, we synthesize handwritten text line images from sentences in corpora and handwritten character patterns in the Nakayosi and Kuchibue database with elastic distortions. In the experiment, we evaluate the performance of the end-to-end model and the effectiveness of the synthetic data generation method on the test set of the TUAT Kondate database. The results of the experiments show that our end-to-end model achieves higher than the state-of-the-art recognition accuracy on the test set of TUAT Kondate with 96.35% and 98.05% character level recognition accuracies without and with the generated synthetic data, respectively.

AB  - Modeling and simulation of Peer-to-Peer (P2P) resources with correlated static and dynamic attributes is essential in application design, validation, and performance analysis. A novel mechanism is presented to generate realistic synthetic traces of multivariate static and dynamic attributes of P2P resources. The methodology is demonstrated using characteristics of Planet-Lab node traces. First, a multi-attribute resource model is defined using a selected set of static and dynamic attributes. Second, characteristics of resources are presented. We observe that attribute values are correlated, follow a mixture of probability distributions, and time series of some of the dynamic attributes are nonstationary. Third, random vectors of static attributes are generated using empirical copulas that capture the entire dependence structure of multivariate distribution of attributes. Finally, time series of dynamic attributes are randomly drawn from a library of multivariate-time-series segments extracted from PlanetLab traces. These segments are identified by detecting the structural changes in time series corresponding to a selected attribute. Time series corresponding to rest of the attributes are split at the same breakpoints and randomly drawn together to preserve their contemporaneous correlation. Furthermore, a tool is developed to automate the synthetic data generation process and its output is validated using statistical tests.

AB  - 5G and beyond (5GB) systems show a flexible characteristic to meet different user communications requirements in parallel. Multi-numerology waveform design is an important part of this human centric characteristic, however, it is necessary to make multi-numerology planning. In this paper, the integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) concept is used with machine learning (ML) techniques to develop an intelligent numerology control mechanism for 5GB. Thanks to the ISAC capabilities, an environment-aware system is designed, and several useful sensing information (USI) that affect the wireless channel characteristic is utilized. It is assumed that the USI is obtained through 5GB smart city networks. At that point, synthetic data generation is performed to form a new dataset with USI-based features. Additionally, a novel feature control algorithm is proposed in the paper. Lastly, simulation results are presented for different type of ML models including several ensemble methods.

AB  - In the study of image and vision computing, the generalization capability of an algorithm often determines whether it is able to work well in complex scenes. The goal of this review article is to survey the use of photorealistic image synthesis methods in addressing the problems of visual perception and understanding. Currently, the ACP Methodology comprising artificial systems, computational experiments, and parallel execution is playing an essential role in modeling and control of complex systems. This paper extends the ACP Methodology into the computer vision field, by proposing the concept and basic framework of Parallel Vision. In this paper, we first review previous works related to Parallel Vision, in terms of synthetic data generation and utilization. We detail the utility of synthetic data for feature analysis, object analysis, scene analysis, and other analyses. Then we propose the basic framework of Parallel Vision, which is composed of an ACP trilogy (artificial scenes, computational experiments, and parallel execution). We also present some in-depth thoughts and perspectives on Parallel Vision. This paper emphasizes the significance of synthetic data to vision system design and suggests a novel research methodology for perception and understanding of complex scenes.

AB  - This paper presents the findings of a study on the profiling of online store users in terms of their likelihood of making a purchase. It also considers the possibility of implementing this solution in the short term. The paper describes the process of developing a profiling model based on data derived from monitoring user behaviour on a website. During the customer's subsequent visits, information is collected to identify the user, record their behaviour on the page and the fact that they made a purchase. The model requires a substantial amount of training data, primarily related to the purchase of products. This represents a small percentage of total website traffic and requires a considerable amount of time to monitor user behaviour. Therefore, we investigated the possibility of using the Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) to generate synthetic data for training the profiling model. The application of GAN would facilitate a more expedient implementation of this model on an online store website. The findings of this study may also prove beneficial to webshop owners and managers, enabling them to gain a deeper insight into their customers and align their price offers or discounts with the profile of a particular user.

AB  - Health Digital Twins (HDTs) are virtual replicas of a patients physical/actual data. The major setbacks for applying Machine Learning (ML) in HDTs are the lack of availability of patients data due to privacy concerns and Artificial Intelligence (AI) bias. Given these shortcomings, synthetic data has been leveraged to solve privacy issues and increase diversity in datasets. In this paper, we evaluate four synthetic data generation models namely, Gaussian Copula, Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Network (CTGAN), CopulaGAN, and Tabular Variational Autoencoder (TVAE) which are used to generate synthetic data for actual sleep data retrieved from a wearable device. Gaussian Copula performed best in capturing the correlation between the variables with the real data with a quality score of approximately 96%. Additionally, we evaluate the efficacy of the synthetic generation models by training five well-known ML models on the generated synthetic data. Our experimental results show that the ML models trained on the synthetic data achieve an MAE (Mean Absolute Error) of less than 10% in the prediction of sleep quality score. The results from this work indicate that synthetic data could be used for ML tasks while preserving the privacy of data subjects.

AB  - African swine fever (ASF) is an emerging disease currently spreading at the interface between wild boar and pig farms in Europe and Asia. Current disease control regulations, which involve massive culling with significant economic and animal welfare costs, need to be improved. Modelling enables relevant control measures to be explored, but conducting the exercise during an epidemic is extremely difficult. Modelling challenges enhance modellers' ability to timely advice policy makers, improve their readiness when facing emerging threats, and promote international collaborations. The ASF-Challenge, which ran between August 2020 and January 2021, was the first modelling challenge in animal health. In this paper, we describe the objectives and rules of the challenge. We then demonstrate the mechanistic multi-host model that was used to mimic as accurately as possible an ASF-like epidemic, provide a detailed explanation of the surveillance and intervention strategies that generated the synthetic data, and describe the different management strategies that were assessed by the competing modelling teams. We then outline the different technical steps of the challenge as well as its envi-ronment. Finally, we synthesize the lessons we learnt along the way to guide future modelling challenges in animal health.

AB  - Modern machine and deep learning methods require large datasets to achieve reliable and robust results. This requirement is often difficult to meet in the medical field, due to data sharing limitations imposed by privacy regulations or the presence of a small number of patients (e.g., rare diseases). To address this data scarcity and to improve the situation, novel generative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been widely used to generate synthetic data that mimic real data by representing features that reflect health-related information without reference to real patients. In this paper, we consider several GAN models to generate synthetic data used for training binary (malignant/benign) classifiers, and compare their performances in terms of classification accuracy with cases where only real data are considered. We aim to investigate how synthetic data can improve classification accuracy, especially when a small amount of data is available. To this end, we have developed and implemented an evaluation framework where binary classifiers are trained on extended datasets containing both real and synthetic data. The results show improved accuracy for classifiers trained with generated data from more advanced GAN models, even when limited amounts of original data are available.

AB  - Data is the fuel of data science and machine learning techniques for smart grid applications, similar to many other fields. However, the availability of data can be an issue due to privacy concerns, data size, data quality, and so on. To this end, in this paper, we propose a Variational AutoEncoder Generative Adversarial Network (VAE-GAN) as a smart grid data generative model which is capable of learning various types of data distributions and generating plausible samples from the same distribution without performing any prior analysis on the data before the training phase. We compared the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), and Wasserstein distance between the synthetic data (electrical load and PV production) distribution generated by the proposed model, vanilla GAN network, and the real data distribution, to evaluate the performance of our model. Furthermore, we used five key statistical parameters to describe the smart grid data distribution and compared them between synthetic data generated by both models and real data. Experiments indicate that the proposed synthetic data generative model outperforms the vanilla GAN network. The distribution of VAE-GAN synthetic data is the most comparable to that of real data.

KW  - LEARNING APPROACH
AB  - The utilization of machine learning in Materials Science underscores the critical importance of the quality and quantity of data in training models effectively. Unlike fields such as image processing and natural language processing, there is limited availability of atomistic datasets, leading to biases in training data. Particularly in the domain of materials discovery, there exists an issue of continuity in atomistic datasets. Experimental data sourced from literature and patents is usually only available for favorable data, resulting in bias in the training dataset. This study focuses on developing a SMILES-based model for generating synthetic datasets of quantum materials using a variational autoencoder. This study centers on the generation of a synthetic dataset of quantum materials specifically for quantum sensing applications, with a focus on two-level quantum molecules that exhibit a dipole blockade. The proposed technique offers an improved sampling algorithm by incorporating newly generated data into the sampling algorithm to create a more normally distributed dataset. Through this technique, the study was able to generate over 1 000 000 candidate quantum materials from a small dataset of only 8000 materials. The generated dataset identified several iodine-containing molecules as promising single photon emitting materials for potential quantum sensing applications.

AB  - The success of deep learning relies on huge datasets. However, in some domains, data is not always accessible due to various constraints. Synthetic data generation helps solve the problem. Collecting face images is challenging due to issues such as privacy. Another issue is that models trained on larger datasets are generally not reused for other related tasks. Therefore, the research aims to facilitate the problems in current face image generation models, such as the lack of quality, huge computational burden, and lack of ability to use pre-trained models. The proposedwork aims to utilize aGenerativeAdversarial Network (GAN) model that uses self-attention and knowledge transfer to generate images of faces resembling images from the CelebA dataset. The proposed model is named TransX2GAN. The ramifications are reduced training time, computational burden, and the ability to reuse deep learning models. Due to the use of self-attention, the quality of generated images has also improved considerably when compared to other models. Compared to the other models the Frechet Inception Distance score and training time has been enhanced by 11.90% and 13.40%, respectively. Hence using transfer learning with attention alleviates some of the important problems in face image generation.

KW  - CONTEXT
AB  - We present a task-aware approach to synthetic data generation. Our framework employs a trainable synthesizer network that is optimized to produce meaningful training samples by assessing the strengths and weaknesses of a 'target' network. The synthesizer and target networks are trained in an adversarial manner wherein each network is updated with a goal to outdo the other. Additionally, we ensure the synthesizer generates realistic data by pairing it with a discriminator trained on real-world images. Further, to make the target classifier invariant to blending artefacts, we introduce these artefacts to background regions of the training images so the target does not over-fit to them.
   We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by applying it to different target networks including a classification network on AffNIST, and two object detection networks (SSD, Faster-RCNN) on different datasets. On the AffNIST benchmark, our approach is able to surpass the baseline results with just half the training examples. On the VOC person detection benchmark, we show improvements of up to 2.7% as a result of our data augmentation. Similarly on the GMU detection benchmark, we report a performance boost of 3.5% in mAP over the baseline method, outperforming the previous state of the art approaches by up to 7.5% on specific categories.

AB  - A multimodal sensor data fusion experiment was performed by exploiting DIRSIG's synthetic data generation capabilities in an urban target detection scenario. Each material in the synthetic scene was attributed with realistic spectral and polarimetric properties, enabling a radiometrically correct calculation of the sensor-reaching-radiance for a notional hyperspectral, multispectral, or polarimetric sensor. The hyperspectral and multispectral data were separately fused with polarimetric data at both the decision and pixel levels, and the impact was assessed by comparing the area under the ROC curves generated by the fused data to the area under the ROC curve generated by the spectral data alone. The impact of additional polarimetric data was shown to be highly dependent on the sensor's viewing geometry, reiterating the complexities involved in polarimetric imaging applications. Also, the impact of additional polarimetric data was demonstrated to depend on the quality of the spatial-spectral information, illustrating the potential to trade spectral resolution for spatial resolution. Further, the decision level fusion algorithm was shown to outperform the pixel level fusion algorithm for the viewing geometries considered, a difference partially explained by the extremely decorrelated nature of the score metrics used as inputs to the decision fusion algorithm.

AB  - In this paper, we tackle the problem of Egocentric Human -Object Interaction (EHOI) detection in an industrial setting. To overcome the lack of public datasets in this context, we propose a pipeline and a tool for generating synthetic images of EHOIs paired with several annotations and data signals (e.g., depth maps or segmentation masks). Using the proposed pipeline, we present EgoISM-HOI a new multimodal dataset composed of synthetic EHOI images in an industrial environment with rich annotations of hands and objects. To demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of synthetic EHOI data produced by the proposed tool, we designed a new method that predicts and combines different multimodal signals to detect EHOIs in RGB images. Our study shows that exploiting synthetic data to pre -train the proposed method significantly improves performance when tested on real -world data. Moreover, to fully understand the usefulness of our method, we conducted an in-depth analysis in which we compared and highlighted the superiority of the proposed approach over different state-of-the-art class -agnostic methods. To support research in this field, we publicly release the datasets, source code, and pre -trained models at https://iplab.dmi.unict.it/egoism-hoi.

AB  - For people with limited mobility, navigating in cluttered indoor environment is challenging. In this work, we propose a mobile assistive furniture suite that is designed to ease the life of people with special needs in indoor movement. To enable intelligent coordination of this system, a key component is the localization of each mobile furniture. The challenge is to assess the state of an arbitrary living scenario so that the estimation can be used as a real-time feedback signal for autonomous closed-loop control of mobile furniture. We propose a perception pipeline that addresses these challenges. A machine learning model is designed and trained to jointly achieve multi-object semantic keypoint detection and classification in camera images. The synthetic data generation is employed to augment the training set and boost the model performance. A robust point cloud registration uses the detected semantic keypoints and depth information to estimate poses of the furniture. Tracking is applied to achieve smooth estimation. A high-performance accelerator that optimizes the efficiency of using heterogeneous devices is applied to achieve real-time performance. This visual perception pipeline is used in closed-loop control to steer the mobile furniture from initial to a desired location demonstrated in experiments on real hardware.

AB  - Microscopy image analysis can provide substantial information for clinical study and understanding of biological structures. Two-photon microscopy is a type of fluorescence microscopy that can fluage deep into tissue with near-infrared excitation light. We arc interested in methods that can detect and characterize nuclei in 3D fluorescence microscopy image volumes. In general, several challenges exist for counting nuclei in 3D image volumes. These include "crowding" and touching of nuclei, overlapping of nuclei, and shape and size variances of the nuclei. In this paper, a 3D nuclei counter using two different generative adversarial networks (CAN) is proposed and evaluated. Synthetic data that resembles real microscopy image is generated with a. CAN and used to train another 3D CAN that counts the number of nuclei. Our approach is evaluated with respect to the number of groundtruth nuclei and compared with common ways of counting used in the biological research. Fluorescence microscopy 3D image volumes of rat kidneys are used to test our 3D nuclei counter. The accuracy results of proposed nuclei counter are compared with the ImageJ's 3D object counter (JACoP) and the 3D watershed. Both the counting accuracy and the object-based evaluation show that the proposed technique is successful for counting nuclei in 3D.

AB  - The discovering of patterns regarding how, when, and where users interact with mobile applications reveals important insights for mobile service providers. In this work, we exploit for the first time a real and large-scale dataset representing the records of mobile application usage of 5,342 users during 2014. The data was collected by a software agent, installed at the users' smartphones, which monitors detailed usage of applications. First, we look for general patterns of how users access some of the most popular mobile applications in terms of frequency, duration, diversity, and data traffic. Next, we mine the dataset looking for temporal patterns in terms of when and how often accesses occur. Finally, we exploit the location of each access to detect users' points of interest and location-based communities. Based on the results, we derive a model to generate synthetic datasets of mobile application usage and evaluate solutions to predict the next application to be launched. We also discuss a series of implications of the findings regarding telecommunication services, mobile advertisements, and smart cities. This is the first time this dataset is used, and we also make it publicly available for other researchers.

AB  - This paper presents a method, based on the Smirnov transform, for generating synthetic data with the statistical properties of Levy-walks. This method for synthetic data generation can be utilized for generating arbitrary prescribed probability density functions (pdf). The Smirnov transform is used to solve a cybersecurity engineering problem associated with Internet traffic. The synthetic Levy-walk process is intertwined with sections of other distinct characteristics (uniform noise, Gaussian noise, and an ordinary sinusoid) to create a composite signal, which is then analyzed with zerocrossing rate (ZCR) within a varying-size window. This paper shows that it is possible to identify the distinct sections present in the composite signal through ZCR. The differentiation of these sections shows an increasing ZCR value as the section under analysis exhibits a higher activity or complexity (from the sinusoid, to a synthetic Levy-walk process, and uniform and Gaussian noise, respectively). The advantages of the ZCR computation directly in the time-domain are appealing for real-time implementations. The varying window in the ZCR produces more defined values as the window size increases.

AB  - Data Mining is the technique of automated extraction of interesting data patterns used to represent knowledge, from the large data sets but sometimes these datasets are divided among various parties. Association rule mining is a popular mining technique that identifies interesting correlations between database attributes. In this paper, proposed a protocol Privacy Preserving Fast Distributed Mining (PPFDM) for association rules mining in horizontally distributed databases which is based on the Fast Distributed Mining (FDM) algorithm. FDM is an unsecured distributed version of the Apriori algorithm devoted to generate a small number of candidate sets and considerably cut down the number of messages to be passed at mining association rules. PPFDM adopts two major ideas: one that computes the union of private subsets that each of the interacting player holds and another that evaluate the inclusion of an element held by one player in a subset held by another.

AB  - Accuracy is a critical factor in predictive modeling. A predictive model such as a decision tree must be accurate to draw conclusions about the system being modeled. This research aims at analyzing and improving the performance of classification and regression trees (CART), a decision tree algorithm, by evaluating and deriving a new methodology based on the performance of real-world data sets that were studied. This paper introduces a new approach to tree induction to improve the efficiency of the CART algorithm by combining the existing functionality of CART with the addition of artificial neural networks (ANNs). Trained ANNs are utilized by the tree induction algorithm by generating new, synthetic data, which have been shown to improve the overall accuracy of the decision tree model when actual training samples are limited. In this paper, traditional decision trees developed by the standard CART methodology are compared with the enhanced decision trees that utilize the ANN's synthetic data generation, or CART+. This research demonstrates the improved accuracies that can be obtained with CART+, which can ultimately improve the knowledge that can be extracted by researchers about a system being modeled.

AB  - Automated segmentation of tissue and cellular structure in H&E images is an important first step towards automated histopathology slide analysis. For example, nuclei segmentation can aid with detecting pleomorphism and epithelium segmentation can aid in identification of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes etc. Existing deep learning-based approaches are often trained organ-wise and lack diversity of training data for multi-organ segmentation networks. In this work, we propose to augment existing nuclei segmentation datasets using cycleGANs. We learn an unpaired mapping from perturbed randomized polygon masks to pseudo-H&E images. We generate over synthetic H&E patches from several different organs for nuclei segmentation. We then use an adversarial U-Net with spectral normalization for increased training stability for segmentation. This paired image-to-image translation style network not only learns the mapping form H&E patches to segmentation masks but also learns an optimal loss function. Such an approach eliminates the need for a hand-crafted loss which has been explored significantly for nuclei segmentation. We demonstrate that the average accuracy for multi-organ nuclei segmentation increases to 94.43% using the proposed synthetic data generation and adversarial U-Net-based segmentation pipeline as compared to 79.81% when no synthetic data and adversarial loss was used.

AB  - Due to the ever increasing data stored in databases, it is important to develop software which can generate large numbers of test data that reflect the properties of a given sample. By generating such data, database algorithms can be stress-tested and evaluated by their performance. If the generated data is much greater in number than the given sample, then the process is called data augmentation or synthetic data generation. Data augmentation can also be very useful in Big Data benchmarking tests. The scope of this paper is to describe a method for statistical data generation based on a given sample, where the generated result attempts to reflect the statistical properties of the sample as much as possible. Throughout the paper we explain how any given data can be represented numerically, and hence clustered using the DBSCAN and K-means algorithms. We introduce a hybrid clustering method, which combines both of the previously mentioned algorithms. The hybrid algorithm focuses on unifying the strengths of both clustering algorithms. After the data is clustered, the individual sub-clusters are statistically analyzed, and based on the analytical results pseudo-random data are generated. The results of the hybrid clustering algorithm show that such artificial data can be created, which reflect the statistical properties of any given sample.

AB  - Context-Aware Recommender Systems (CARS) have started to attract significant research attention in the last years, due to the interest of considering the context of the user in order to offer him/her more appropriate recommendations. However, the evaluation of CARS is a challenge, due to the scarce availability of appropriate datasets that incorporate context information related to the ratings provided by the users.
   In this paper, we present DataGenCARS, a complete Java-based synthetic dataset generator that can be used to obtain the required datasets for any type of scenario desired, allowing a high flexibility in the obtention of appropriate data that can be used to evaluate CARS. The generator presents features such as: a flexible definition of user schemas, user profiles, types of items, and types of contexts; a realistic generation of ratings and attributes of items; the possibility to mix real and synthetic datasets; functionalities to analyze existing datasets as a basis for synthetic data generation; and support for the automatic mapping between item schemas and Java classes. Moreover, an experimental evaluation illustrates the interest and the benefits provided by DataGenCARS. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Rapid Benchmarking for semantic web knowledge base systems
T2  - SEMANTIC WEB - ISWC 2005, PROCEEDINGS
LA  - English
CP  - 4th International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC 2005)
AB  - We present a method for rapid development of benchmarks for Semantic Web knowledge base systems. At the core, we have a synthetic data generation approach for OWL that is scalable and models the real world data. The data-generation algorithm learns from real domain documents and generates benchmark data based on the extracted properties relevant for benchmarking. We believe that this is important because relative performance of systems will vary depending on the structure of the ontology and data used. However, due to the novelty of the Semantic Web, we rarely have sufficient data for benchmarking. Our approach helps overcome the problem of having insufficient real world data for benchmarking and allows us to develop benchmarks for a variety of domains and applications in a very time efficient manner. Based on our method, we have created a new Lehigh BibTeX Benchmark and conducted an experiment on four Semantic Web knowledge base systems. We have verified our hypothesis about the need for representative data by comparing the experimental result to that of our previous Lehigh University Benchmark. The difference in both experiments has demonstrated the influence of ontology and data on the capability and performance of the systems and thus the need of using a representative benchmark for the intended application of the systems.

AB  - Industry increasingly focuses on data-driven digital twins of production lines, especially for planning, controlling and optimising applications. However, the lack of open data on manufacturing systems presents a challenge to the development of new data-driven strategies. To fill this gap, the paper aim to introduce a strategy for generating random production lines and simulating their behaviour, thus enabling the generation of synthetic data. So far, such data can be recorded in event logs or machine status format, with the latter adopted for the use cases. To do so, the production lines are modelled using complex network concepts, with the system's behaviour simulated via an algorithm in Python. Three use cases were assessed, in order to present possible applications. Firstly, the stabilisation of working, starved and blocked machines was investigated until a steady state was reached. The system behaviour was then investigated for different model parameters and simulation intervals. Finally, the production bottleneck behaviour (a phenomenon that can harm the production capacity of manufacturing systems) was statistically studied and described. The authors anticipate that this artificial and parametric data benchmark will enable the development of data-driven techniques without prior need for a real dataset.

AB  - A crucial aspect of every experiment is the formulation of hypotheses prior to data collection. In this paper, we use a simulation-based approach to generate synthetic data and formulate the hypotheses for our market experiment and calibrate its laboratory design. In this experiment, we extend well-established laboratory market models to the two-asset case, accounting at the same time for heterogeneous artificial traders with multi-asset strategies. Our main objective is to identify the role played in the price-bubble formation by both self-impact (i.e., how trading orders affect the price dynamics) and cross-impact (i.e., the price changes in one asset caused by the trading activity on other assets). To this end, we vary across treatments the possibility of traders of diverting their capital from one asset to the other, thereby artificially changing the amount of liquidity in the market. To simulate different scenarios for the synthetic data generation, we vary along with the liquidity the type of trading strategies of our artificial traders. Our results suggest that an increase in liquidity increases the cross-impact, especially when agents are market-neutral. Self-impact, however, remains significant and constant for all model specifications.

AB  - Access to private medical data is restricted due to privacy laws, hindering research and real-world use. Synthetic data generation provides a viable solution by generating data with high utility and privacy pro-tection without releasing the real data. Healthcare data records are often longitudinal in nature, being affected by covariates like age, gender, ethnicity, etc. As a result, synthetic healthcare data generation falls in the domain of time-series modeling and requires time-series based measures to investigate real and synthetic data resemblance. Covariate plots can be used for qualitative time-series resemblance but lack an empirical quantitative measure, thus, resulting in interpretations biased towards viewer's per-spective. In this paper, we describe four time-series metrics to quantitatively evaluate the real and syn-thetic time-series resemblance on datasets from previously published healthcare research studies, both public and private. We apply the metrics on covariate plots for synthetic datasets to investigate the resemblance and compare the results with baseline synthetic datasets. We infer that the metrics effec-tively capture the time-series resemblance between real and synthetic datasets. The results highlight varying degrees of resemblance across sub-groups of covariates and multivariate time-series.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Humans naturally use verbal utterances and nonverbal gestures to refer to various objects (known as referring expressions) in different interactional scenarios. As collecting real human interaction datasets are costly and laborious, synthetic datasets are often used to train models to unambiguously detect relationships among objects. However, existing synthetic data generation tools that provide referring expressions generally neglect nonverbal gestures. Additionally, while a few small-scale datasets contain multimodal cues (verbal and nonverbal), these datasets only capture the nonverbal gestures from an exo-centric perspective (observer). As models can use complementary information from multimodal cues to recognize referring expressions, generating multimodal data from multiple views can help to develop robust models. To address these critical issues, in this paper, we present a novel embodied simulator, CAESAR, to generate multimodal referring expressions containing both verbal utterances and nonverbal cues captured from multiple views. Using our simulator, we have generated two large-scale embodied referring expression datasets, which we have released publicly (1). We have conducted experimental analyses on embodied spatial relation grounding using various state-of-the-art baseline models. Our experimental results suggest that visual perspective affects the models' performance; and that nonverbal cues improve spatial relation grounding accuracy. Finally, we will release the simulator publicly to allow researchers to generate new embodied interaction datasets.

AB  - We propose a new approach to portfolio optimization that utilizes a unique combination of synthetic data generation and a CVaR-constraint. We formulate the portfolio optimization problem as an asset allocation problem in which each asset class is accessed through a passive (index) fund. The asset-class weights are determined by solving an optimization problem which includes a CVaR-constraint. The optimization is carried out by means of a Modified CTGAN algorithm which incorporates features (contextual information) and is used to generate synthetic return scenarios, which, in turn, are fed into the optimization engine. For contextual information, we rely on several points along the U.S. Treasury yield curve. The merits of this approach are demonstrated with an example based on 10 asset classes (covering stocks, bonds, and commodities) over a fourteen-and-half-year period (January 2008-June 2022). We also show that the synthetic generation process is able to capture well the key characteristics of the original data, and the optimization scheme results in portfolios that exhibit satisfactory out-of-sample performance. We also show that this approach outperforms the conventional equal-weights (1/N) asset allocation strategy and other optimization formulations based on historical data only.

AB  - Artificial intelligence or machine-learning-based models have proven useful for better understanding various diseases in all areas of health science. Myalgic Encephalomyelitis or chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) lacks objective diagnostic tests. Some validated questionnaires are used for diagnosis and assessment of disease progression. The availability of a sufficiently large database of these questionnaires facilitates research into new models that can predict profiles that help to understand the etiology of the disease. A synthetic data generator provides the scientific community with databases that preserve the statistical properties of the original, free of legal restrictions, for use in research and education. The initial databases came from the Vall Hebron Hospital Specialized Unit in Barcelona, Spain. 2522 patients diagnosed with ME/CFS were analyzed. Their answers to questionnaires related to the symptoms of this complex disease were used as training datasets. They have been fed for deep learning algorithms that provide models with high accuracy [0.69-0.81]. The final model requires SF-36 responses and returns responses from HAD, SCL-90R, FIS8, FIS40, and PSQI questionnaires. A highly reliable and easy-to-use synthetic data generator is offered for research and educational use in this disease, for which there is currently no approved treatment.

AB  - Advanced route planning algorithms are one of the key enabling technologies for emerging electric and autonomous mobility. Large realistic data sets are needed to test such algorithms under conditions that capture natural time-varying traffic patterns and corresponding travel-time and energy-use predictions. Further, the time-varying availability of charging infrastructure and vehicle-specific charging-power curves may be necessary to support advanced planning. While some data sets and synthetic data generators capture some of the aspects mentioned above, no integrated testbeds include all of them. We contribute with a modular testbed architecture. First, it includes a semi-synthetic data generator that uses a state-of-the-art traffic simulator, real traffic volume distribution patterns, EV-specific data, and elevation data. These elements support the generation of time-dependent travel-time and energy-use weights in a road-network graph. The generator ensures that the data satisfies the FIFO property, which is essential for time-dependent routing. Next, the testbed provides a thin layer of services that can serve as building blocks for future advanced routing algorithms. The experimental study demonstrates that the testbed can reproduce travel-time and energy-use patterns for long-distance trips similar to commercially available services.

AB  - A synthetic data generation procedure is a procedure to generate data from either a statistical or mathematical model. The data generation procedure has been used in simulation studies to compare statistical performance methods or propose a new statistical method with a specific distribution. A synthetic multivariate data generation procedure with various outlier scenarios using R is formulated in this study. An outlier generating model is used to generate multivariate data that contains outliers. Data generation procedures for various outlier scenarios by using R are explained. Three outlier scenarios are produced, and graphical representations using 3D scatterplot and Chernoff faces for these outlier scenarios are shown. The graphical representation shows that as the distance between outliers and inliers by shifting the mean,. increases in Outlier Scenario 1, the outliers and inliers are completely separated. The same pattern can also be seen when the distance between outliers and inliers, by shifting the covariance,. increase in Outlier Scenario 2. For Outlier Scenario 3, when both values. and. increase, the separation of outliers and inliers are more apparent. The data generation procedure in this study will be continually used in other applications, such as identifying outliers by using the clustering method.

AB  - A novel synthetic data generation methodology is described for use in the development of pattern recognition classifiers that are employed for the automated detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) during infrared remote sensing measurements. The approach used is passive Fourier transform infrared spectrometry implemented in a downward-looking mode on an aircraft platform. A key issue in developing this methodology in practice is the need for example data that can be used to train the classifiers. To replace the time-consuming and costly collection of training data in the field, this work implements a strategy for taking laboratory analyte spectra and superimposing them on background spectra collected from the air. The resulting synthetic spectra can be used to train the classifiers. This methodology is tested by developing classifiers for ethanol and methanol, two prevalent VOCs in wide industrial use. The classifiers are successfully tested with data collected from the aircraft during controlled releases of ethanol and during a methanol release from an industrial facility. For both ethanol and methanol, missed detections in the aircraft data are in the range of 4 to 5%, with false positive detections ranging from 0.1 to 0.3%.

AB  - Facial micro-expressions indicate brief and subtle facial movements that appear during emotional communication. In comparison to macro-expressions, micro-expressions are more challenging to be analyzed due to the short span of time and the fine-grained changes. In recent years, micro-expression recognition (MER) has drawn much attention because it can benefit a wide range of applications, e.g., police interrogation, clinical diagnosis, depression analysis, and business negotiation. In this survey, we offer a fresh overview to discuss new research directions and challenges these days for MER tasks. For example, we review MER approaches from three novel aspects: macro-to-micro adaptation, recognition based on key apex frames, and recognition based on facial action units. Moreover, to mitigate the problem of limited and biased ME data, synthetic data generation is surveyed for the diversity enrichment of micro-expression data. Since micro-expression spotting can boost micro-expression analysis, the state-of-the-art spotting works are also introduced in this paper. At last, we discuss the challenges in MER research and provide potential solutions as well as possible directions for further investigation.

AB  - Recent studies suggest that the interaction between the brain and heart plays a key role in cog-nitive processes, and measuring these interactions is crucial for understanding the interaction between the central and autonomic nervous systems. However, studying this bidirectional inter-play presents methodological challenges, and there is still much room for exploration. This paper presents a new computational method called the Poincare Sympathetic-Vagal Synthetic Data Gen-eration Model (PSV-SDG) for estimating brain-heart interactions. The PSV-SDG combines EEG and cardiac sympathetic-vagal dynamics to provide time-varying and bidirectional estimators of mu-tual interplay. The method is grounded in the Poincare plot, a heart rate variability method to estimate sympathetic-vagal activity that can account for potential non-linearities. This algorithm offers a new approach and computational tool for functional assessment of the interplay between EEG and cardiac sympathetic-vagal activity. The method is implemented in MATLAB under an open-source license.center dot A new brain-heart interaction modeling approach is proposed.center dot The modeling is based on coupled synthetic data generators of EEG and heart rate series.center dot Sympathetic and vagal activities are gathered from Poincare plot geometry.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a framework for 3D human pose estimation using a single 360 degrees camera mounted on the user's wrist. Perceiving a 3D human pose with such a simple setup has remarkable potential for various applications (e.g., daily-living activity monitoring, motion analysis for sports training). However, no existing method has tackled this task due to the difficulty of estimating a human pose from a single camera image in which only a part of the human body is captured, and because of a lack of training data. We propose a method for translating wrist-mounted 360 degrees camera images into 3D human poses. Since we are the first to try this task, we cannot use existing datasets. To address this issue, we use synthetic data to build our own dataset. This solution, however, creates a different problem, that of a domain gap between synthetic data for training and real image data for inference. To resolve this problem, we propose silhouette-based synthetic data generation created for this task. Extensive experiments comparing our method with several baseline methods demonstrated the effectiveness of our silhouette-based pose estimation approach.

AB  - Recent advances have facilitated the development and popularization of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) that can operate semi or fully autonomously. The real-time, accurate visual detection of UAVs is crucial for various tasks and applications including surveillance (e.g., detecting UAVs flying over restricted areas such as airports) or multi-robot systems (e.g., a swarm of UAVs that need to cooperate and avoid collisions between swarm members in GPS-denied environments). The small target-to-image ratio and large similarity with other flying objects makes the visual detection of UAVs a challenging task. In addition, data distribution shifts can have a major negative impact to UAV detection frameworks, often trained on a wide variety of datasets to achieve an adequate level of robustness. As an attempt to mitigate the effect of these issues, we present a method that can generate realistic annotated video data depicting flying UAVs, using as input real background videos and 3D UAV models. The conducted experimental evaluation showed that the synthetic data are both challenging and realistic and that detectors trained on a combination of real-world and synthetic data, exhibit an improved generalization performance, achieving better precision rates when evaluated on real datasets that are visually distinct from the corresponding real training data.

AB  - Recent advances in artificial intelligence, control and sensing technologies have facilitated the development of autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Detecting humans from video input captured on-the-fly from UAVs is a critical task for ensuring flight safety, mostly handled with lightweight Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However the detection of individual people in the case of dense crowds and/or distribution shifts (i.e., significant visual differences between the training and the test sets) is still very challenging. This paper presents AUTH-Persons, a new, annotated, publicly available video dataset, that consists of both real and synthetic footage, suitable for training and evaluating aerial-view person detection algorithms. The synthetic data were collected from 8 visually distinct photorealistic outdoor environments and they mostly contain scenes with crowded areas, where heavy occlusions and high person densities pose challenges to common detectors. This dataset is employed to evaluate the generalization performance of various state-of-the-art detection frameworks, by testing them on environments that are visually distinct from those they have been trained on. Finally, given that Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) methods at the end of person detection pipelines typically suffer in crowded scenes, the performance of various NMS algorithms is also compared in AUTH-Persons.

AB  - Many agencies are investigating whether releasing synthetic microdata could be a viable dissemination strategy for highly sensitive data, such as business data, for which disclosure avoidance regulations otherwise prohibit the release of public use microdata. However, existing methods assume that the original data either cover the entire population or comprise a simple random sample, which limits the application of these methods in the context of survey data with unequal weights. This paper discusses synthetic data generation under informative sampling. To utilise design information in survey weights, we rely on the pseudo likelihood approach when building a hierarchical Bayesian model to estimate the distribution of the finite population. Then, synthetic populations are randomly drawn from the estimated finite population density. We present the full conditional distributions of the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for posterior inference with the pseudo likelihood function. Using simulation studies, we show that the suggested synthetic data approach offers high utility for design-based and model-based analyses while offering a high level of disclosure protection. We apply the proposed method to a subset of the 2012 U.S. Economic Census and evaluate results with utility metrics and disclosure avoidance metrics under data attacker scenarios commonly used for business data.

AB  - In the recent years, there has been an increasing academic and industrial interest for analyzing the electrical consumption of commercial buildings. Whilst having similarities with the Non Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) tasks for residential buildings, the nature of the signals that are collected from large commercial buildings introduces additional difficulties to the NILM research causing existing NILM approaches to fail. On the other hand, the amount of publicly available datasets collected from commercial buildings is very limited, which makes the NILM research even more challenging for this type of large buildings. In this study, we aim at addressing these issues. We first present an extensive statistical analysis of both commercial and residential measurements from public and private datasets and show important differences. Secondly, we develop an algorithm for generating synthetic current data based on a modelization of the current Flowing through an electrical device. We then demonstrate that our electrical device model fits well real measurements and that our simulations are realistic by using the quantitative metrics described in the previous section. Finally, to encourage research on commercial buildings we release a synthesized dataset called SHED that can be used to evaluate NILM algorithms. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The goal of this paper is to build a system that automatically creates synthetic data to enable data science endeavors. To achieve this, we present the Synthetic Data Vault (SDV), a system that builds generative models of relational databases. We are able to sample from the model and create synthetic data, hence the name SDV. When implementing the SDV, we also developed an algorithm that computes statistics at the intersection of related database tables. We then used a state-of-the-art multivariate modeling approach to model this data. The SDV iterates through all possible relations, ultimately creating a model for the entire database. Once this model is computed, the same relational information allows the SDV to synthesize data by sampling from any part of the database.
   After building the SDV, we used it to generate synthetic data for five different publicly available datasets. We then published these datasets, and asked data scientists to develop predictive models for them as part of a crowdsourced experiment. By analyzing the outcomes, we show that synthetic data can successfully replace original data for data science. Our analysis indicates that there is no significant difference in the work produced by data scientists who used synthetic data as opposed to real data. We conclude that the SDV is a viable solution for synthetic data generation.

AB  - Pixel-wise image segmentation is key for many Computer Vision applications. The training of deep neural networks for this task has expensive pixel-level annotation requirements, thus, motivating a growing interest on synthetic data to provide unlimited data and its annotations. In this paper, we focus on the generation and application of synthetic data as representative training corpuses for semantic segmentation of urban scenes. First, we propose a synthetic data generation protocol, which identifies key features affecting performance and provides datasets with variable complexity. Second, we adapt two popular weakly supervised domain adaptation approaches (combined training, fine-tuning) to employ synthetic and real data. Moreover, we analyze several backbone models, real/synthetic datasets and their proportions when combined. Third, we propose a new curriculum learning strategy to employ several synthetic and real datasets. Our major findings suggest the high performance impact of pace and order of synthetic and real data presentation, achieving state of the art results for well-known models. The results by training with the proposed dataset outperform popular alternatives, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed protocol.

AB  - The financial sector accumulates a massive amount of consumer data that contain the most sensitive information daily. These data are strictly limited outside the financial institutions, sometimes even within the same organization, for various reasons such as privacy laws or asset management policy. Financial data has never been more valuable, especially when assessed jointly with data from different industries, including healthcare, insurance, credit bureau, and research institutions. Therefore, it is critical to generate synthetic datasets that retain the statistical or latent properties of the real datasets as well as the privacy protection guaranteed. In this paper, we apply Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) to generating synthetic consumer credit data to be used for various educational purposes, specifically in developing machine learning models. GAN is preferable to other pseudonymization methods such as masking, swapping, shuffling, or perturbation, for it does not suffer from adding more attributes or data. This study is significant because it is the first attempt to generate the synthetic data of real-world credit data in practical use. The results find that synthetic consumer credit data using GAN shows a substantial utility without severely compromising privacy and would be a useful resource for big data training programs.

AB  - The characterization of the subsurface is paramount for the exploration and production life cycle and, more specifically, for the identification of potential hydrocarbon accumulations. In recent years, the oil and gas industry has increased its interest in applying machine learning to accelerate the seismic interpretation process, which is regarded as a time-consuming and human-centered task. Although machine learning has been successfully used in many applications ranging from stratigraphic segmentation to salt dome detection, a usual bottleneck is the need for a large amount of high-quality annotated data. To overcome this, data augmentation approaches are commonly used, and one of the most powerful is synthetic data generation. In addition, sketch-based synthetic seismic images can be used to support image retrieval applications to help oil companies leverage petabytes of seismic data sets. In this context, this letter investigates the generation of synthetic seismic images based on sketches using generative adversarial networks (GANs). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose such an approach. Experiments with five different sketch types in a public seismic data set indicate that realistic seismic images can be synthesized using rather simple sketches.

AB  - This study develops a scale-dependent synthetic data generation method for streamflow by using a continuous wavelet transform. The detailed information of streamflow variability across different timescales embedded in the data is obtained from the continuous wavelet transform. To take into account the time-dependent flow magnitudes, the wavelet coefficients are simply separated into two basic categories, namely high-flow part and low-flow part. The data reconstruction is based on the random permutation of the separated wavelet coefficients for the two categories. The synthetic generation is performed at both the individual timescales and the multiple timescales. The Morlet wavelet transform is considered as a representative continuous wavelet transform, and generation of daily streamflow data is attempted. The method is applied to a streamflow series observed in the Pearl River basin in South China. The results indicate that the proposed method: (1) is suitable for scale-controlled generation of streamflow time series and (2) provides reliable information as to the extent of spectral properties present in the original data that need to be preserved.

AB  - Benchmarking pattern recognition, machine learning and data mining methods commonly relies on real-world data sets. However, there are some disadvantages in using real-world data. On one hand collecting real-world data can become difficult or impossible for various reasons, on the other hand real-world variables are hard to control, even in the problem domain; in the feature domain, where most statistical learning methods operate, exercising control is even more difficult and hence rarely attempted. This is at odds with the scientific experimentation guidelines mandating the use of as directly controllable and as directly observable variables as possible. Because of this, synthetic data possesses certain advantages over real-world data sets. In this paper we propose a method that produces synthetic data with guaranteed global and class-specific statistical properties. This method is based on overlapping class densities placed on the corners of a regular k-simplex. This generator can be used for algorithm testing and fair performance evaluation of statistical learning methods. Because of the strong properties of this generator researchers can reproduce each others experiments by knowing the parameters used, instead of transmitting large data sets. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The ability to forecast human-environment collisions from egocentric observations is vital to enable collision avoidance in applications such as VR, AR, and wearable assistive robotics. In this work, we introduce the challenging problem of predicting collisions in diverse environments from multi-view egocentric videos captured from body-mounted cameras. Solving this problem requires a generalizable perception system that can classify which human body joints will collide and estimate a collision region heatmap to localize collisions in the environment. To achieve this, we propose a transformer-based model called COPILOT to perform collision prediction and localization simultaneously, which accumulates information across multi-view inputs through a novel 4D space-time-viewpoint attention mechanism. To train our model and enable future research on this task, we develop a synthetic data generation framework that produces egocentric videos of virtual humans moving and colliding within diverse 3D environments. This framework is then used to establish a large-scale dataset consisting of 8.6M egocentric RGBD frames. Extensive experiments show that COPILOT generalizes to unseen synthetic as well as real-world scenes. We further demonstrate COPILOT outputs are useful for downstream collision avoidance through simple closed-loop control.

AB  - Mobile network traffic data offers unprecedented opportunities for innovative studies within and beyond networking. However, progress is hindered by the very limited access that the research community at large has to the real-world mobile network data that is needed to develop and dependably test mobile traffic data-driven solutions. As a contribution to overcome this barrier, we propose CartaGenie, a generator of realistic mobile traffic snapshots at city scale. Taking a deep generative modeling approach and through a tailored conditional generator design, CartaGenie can synthesize high-fidelity and artifact-free spatial traffic snapshots using only contextual information about the target geographical region that is easily found in public repositories. Hence, CartaGenie allows researchers to create their own realistic datasets of spatial traffic from open data about their region of interest. Experiments with real-world mobile traffic measurements collected in multiple metropolitan areas show that CartaGenie can produce dependable network traffic loads for areas where no prior traffic information is available, significantly outperforming a comprehensive set of benchmarks. Moreover, tests with practical case studies demonstrate that the synthetic data generated by CartaGenie is as good as real data in supporting diverse research-oriented mobile traffic data-driven applications.

AB  - Two studies have been performed to analyse the sensitivity of design parameters on different statistical analysis techniques. In the first study two methods for synthetic data generation of hurricane wind fields in the Gulf of Khambhat have been applied to derive the probability of exceedance of wind speed at a location in the North of the Gulf of Khambhat. The first method is based on random track replacement of historical hurricanes. The second method is an extension to the first one, in the sense that the peak wind speeds are taken from a logarithmic distribution. The simulations indicate that the inclusion of a random hurricane intensity can have significant effects on the design wind speed. In the second study an analysis was made of the sensitivity of the design deck level on various approaches of taking the joint occurrence of waves and water levels into account. In addition, the directionally sorted peaks method has been applied. The results indicate that a separate analysis of waves and water levels gives the highest results of the design deck level. Inclusion of information about the joint occurrence of waves and water levels decreases the design deck lever. Besides, inclusion of directional information may lead to a further decrease of the design deck level.

AB  - Background The digital transformation of pathology through the widespread use of so-called whole slide scanners offers numerous opportunities for nephropathology, especially with respect to the implementation of computer assistance. Currently, the possibilities of systems based on the use of deep learning, a special technique of information processing, are being intensively explored. Objective The aim is to determine the current state of research regarding applications of deep learning methods for image analysis in nephropathology. Material and methods A literature search was carried out in Web of Science (WOS) and PubMed. For figure one the following search query in WOS was used: ALL= (digital pathology AND AI OR deep learning OR machine learning). Results There are numerous applications of deep learning-based methods to assist in nephropathology. These focus largely on segmentation and quantification of renal histology, although diagnostic classification and synthetic data generation are also increasingly being explored. The translation of these systems into everyday diagnostic practice has not yet taken place. For example, prospective evidence demonstrating the utility of these methods in clinical care is lacking. Conclusion The implementation of digital nephropathology with assistance from deep learning-based methods has great potential. The translational gap should be filled by multicenter prospective interdisciplinary studies in the future.

TI  - Requirements for Parametric Design of Physics-Based Synthetic Data Generation for Learning and Inference of Defect Conditions

CP  - 2nd Joint Conference of the Construction Research Congress (CRC) / Construction-Institute (CI) Summit
AB  - The advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven defect detection has already demonstrated promises to boost quality assurance and control, as well as condition assessment in the built environment. However, training defect detection models requires hefty amounts of reality capture data, and labeling is considered expensive. In most cases, such data may not cover all situations of defects. Synthetic data, most recently made with Building Information Models (BIM), is turbocharging model development for learning defect features. Nevertheless, few studies focused on characterizing defects to classify their severity, which is crucial to the condition assessment. To that end, this study explores the requirements for generating synthetic data. Parametric physics-based modeling approaches are carefully examined. Using the underlying geometric properties of such data, the condition of each defect can be determined. The feasibility of synthetic defect data is validated with a case study of crack segmentation using the transformer-based model, SegFormer. Examples of how different scenarios can be generated photo-realistically with the use of physics-based rendering for creating varying geometrical characteristics, appearance, and viewpoints of defects are presented. The generated synthetic crack datasets can successfully be used to train the SegFormer model and reach promising predictions on real crack images.

AB  - Over the past decade, the use of machine learning and deep learning algorithms to support 3D semantic segmentation of point clouds has significantly increased, and their impressive results has led to the application of such algorithms for the semantic modeling of heritage buildings. Nevertheless, such applications still face several significant challenges, caused in particular by the high number of training data required during training, by the lack of specific data in the heritage building scenarios, and by the time-consuming operations to data collection and annotation. This paper aims to address these challenges by proposing a workflow for synthetic image data generation in heritage building scenarios. Specifically, the procedure allows for the generation of multiple rendered images from various viewpoints based on a 3D model of a building. Additionally, it enables the generation of per-pixel segmentation maps associated with these images. In the first part, the procedure is tested by generating a synthetic simulation of a real-world scenario using the case study of Spedale del Ceppo. In the second part, several experiments are conducted to assess the impact of synthetic data during training. Specifically, three neural network architectures are trained using the generated synthetic images, and their performance in predicting the corresponding real scenarios is evaluated.

AB  - Testing techniques for database applications typically include generation of database states (synthetic data) along with automatic generation of test cases. The quality of such test cases is evaluated on the basis of structural coverage of the host language (e. g., Java), whereas, the quality of test cases for the embedded language (e. g., SQL) is evaluated separately using mutation testing. In mutation testing, several mutants or variants of the original SQL query are generated and mutation score is calculated. It is the percentage of mutants that can be differentiated in terms of their results using the given test cases. Higher mutation score indicates higher quality of the test cases. In existing approaches the generated test cases achieve high structural coverage with respect to the generated synthetic data, but suffer from low mutation score with respect to the same data. We present a novel framework called SynConSMutate for test case and synthetic data generation for database applications. The generated test cases with respect to the newly generated synthetic data ensure high quality not only in terms of coverage of code written in the host language, but also in terms of mutant detection of the queries written in the embedded language.

AB  - Deep Learning is being widely utilized in industrial process monitoring, control, and optimization. However, in the wastewater industry, its applications are still under-explored. This is because deep learning requires a large amount of labeled training data to induce effective predictive models. Due to the high cost of sensors and frequency and delay in sampling and laboratory analytics, wastewater treatment process data can be sparse with varying frequencies. One option to address training data limitations is to use transfer learning. However, due to the large covariate shift between the commonly adopted source domains for transfer learning, and the target domain of wastewater processes, this approach leads to unacceptable performance. We address this issue by proposing a novel synthetic data generation method for deep predictive modeling of wastewater plants. Employing a Markov process that utilizes random walk, our technique enables the generation of abundant annotated data for our target domain. The method preserves the temporal dynamics and distribution of the original data, thereby closely mimicking the potential original samples of the domain. We extensively evaluate our method over two different high rate algae based treatment data sets, demonstrating considerable performance gains over existing transfer learning. Our proposed algorithm can assist plant operators to deploy responsive supportive models with limited data.

AB  - 3D particle streak velocimetry (3D-PSV) and surface flow visualization using tufts both require the detection of curve segments, particle streaks or tufts, in images. We propose the use of deep learning based instance segmentation neural networks Mask region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN) and Cascade Mask R-CNN, trained on fully synthetic data, to accurately identify, segment, and classify streaks and tufts. For 3D-PSV, we use the segmented masks and detected streak endpoints to volumetrically reconstruct flows even when the imaged streaks partly overlap or intersect. In addition, we use Mask R-CNN to segment images of tufts and classify the detected tufts according to their range of motion, thus automating the detection of regions of separated flow while at the same time providing accurate segmentation masks. Finally, we show a successful synthetic-to-real transfer by training only on synthetic data and successfully evaluating real data. The synthetic data generation is particularly suitable for the two presented applications, as the experimental images consist of simple geometric curves or a superposition of curves. Therefore, the proposed networks provide a general framework for instance detection, keypoint detection and classification that can be fine-tuned to the specific experimental application and imaging parameters using synthetic data.

AB  - Traffic sign detection and recognition perform a vital function in real-world driver guidance applications, including driver assistance systems. Research into vision-based traffic sign detection (TSD) and traffic sign recognition (TSR) has gained considerable attention in the scientific community, led mainly by three variables: identification, monitoring, and classification. In addition, TSR provides valuable details and alerts for smart cars including advanced driving assistance (ADAS) and cooperative intelligent transport systems (CITS). Our work will generate high-quality synthetic prohibitory sign images using deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGAN). This paper analyzes and discusses CNN models incorporating different backbone architectures and feature extractors, focusing on Resnet 50 and Densenet for object detection. Assessment of the models provides important information, including mean average accuracy (mAP), workspace capacity, detection period, and the amount of billion floating-point operations (BFLOPS). The maximum average accuracy is 92% (Densenet DCGAN), led by 91% (Resnet 50 DCGAN), 88% (Densenet), and 63% (Resnet 50). We find when using the original image and a synthetic image, accuracy increases, while detection time falls. Our findings show that combining original images and synthetic images in the dataset for training can improve intersection over union (IoU) and traffic sign recognition performance.

T2  - 15TH ACM CONFERENCE ON RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS (RECSYS 2021)
LA  - English
CP  - 15th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems (RECSYS)
AB  - We investigate whether model extraction can be used to 'steal' the weights of sequential recommender systems, and the potential threats posed to victims of such attacks. This type of risk has attracted attention in image and text classification, but to our knowledge not in recommender systems. We argue that sequential recommender systems are subject to unique vulnerabilities due to the specific autoregressive regimes used to train them. Unlike many existing recommender attackers, which assume the dataset used to train the victim model is exposed to attackers, we consider a data-free setting, where training data are not accessible. Under this setting, we propose an API-based model extraction method via limited-budget synthetic data generation and knowledge distillation. We investigate state-of-the-art models for sequential recommendation and show their vulnerability under model extraction and downstream attacks.
   We perform attacks in two stages. (1) Model extraction: given different types of synthetic data and their labels retrieved from a black-box recommender, we extract the black-box model to a white-box model via distillation. (2) Downstream attacks: we attack the black-box model with adversarial samples generated by the white-box recommender. Experiments show the effectiveness of our data-free model extraction and downstream attacks on sequential recommenders in both profile pollution and data poisoning settings.

AB  - We propose an approach for learning probability distributions as differentiable quantum circuits (DQC) that enable efficient quantum generative modeling (QGM) and synthetic data generation. Contrary to existing QGM approaches, we perform training of a DQC-based model, where data is encoded in a latent space with the proposed phase feature map of exponential capacity. This is followed by a trainable quantum circuit, forming the model. We then map the trained model to the bit basis using a fixed unitary transformation, in this case corresponding to a quantum Fourier transform circuit. It allows fast sampling from parametrized distributions using a single-shot readout. Importantly, latent space training provides models that are automatically differentiable, and we show how samples from solutions of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) can be accessed by solving stationary and time-dependent Fokker-Planck equations with a quantum protocol. Our approach opens a route to multidimensional generative modeling with qubit registers explicitly correlated via a (fixed) entangling layer. In this case quantum computers can offer advantage as efficient samplers, which perform complex inverse transform sampling enabled by the fundamental laws of quantum mechanics. On a technical side the advances are multiple, as we introduce the phase feature map, analyze its properties, and develop frequency-taming techniques that include qubitwise training and feature map sparsification.

AB  - We address the need for a large-scale database of children's faces by using generative adversarial networks (GANs) and face-age progression (FAP) models to synthesize a realistic dataset referred to as "HDA-SynChildFaces". Hence, we proposed a processing pipeline that initially utilizes StyleGAN3 to sample adult subjects, which is subsequently progressed to children of varying ages using InterFaceGAN. Intra-subject variations, such as facial expression and pose, are created by further manipulating the subjects in their latent space. Additionally, this pipeline allows the even distribution of the races of subjects, allowing the generation of a balanced and fair dataset with respect to race distribution. The resulting HDA-SynChildFaces consists of 1,652 subjects and 188,328 images, each subject being present at various ages and with many different intra-subject variations. We then evaluated the performance of various facial recognition systems on the generated database and compared the results of adults and children at different ages. The study reveals that children consistently perform worse than adults on all tested systems and that the degradation in performance is proportional to age. Additionally, our study uncovers some biases in the recognition systems, with Asian and black subjects and females performing worse than white and Latino-Hispanic subjects and males.

AB  - Monitoring species-specific dry herbage biomass is an important aspect of pasture-based milk production systems. Being aware of the herbage biomass in the field enables farmers to manage surpluses and deficits in herbage supply, as well as using targeted nitrogen fertilization when necessary. Deep learning for computer vision is a powerful tool in this context as it can accurately estimate the dry biomass of a herbage parcel using images of the grass canopy taken using a portable device. However, the performance of deep learning comes at the cost of an extensive, and in this case destructive, data gathering process. Since accurate species-specific biomass estimation is labor intensive and destructive for the herbage parcel, we propose in this paper to study low supervision approaches to dry biomass estimation using computer vision. Our contributions include: a synthetic data generation algorithm to generate data for a herbage height aware semantic segmentation task, an automatic process to label data using semantic segmentation maps, and a robust regression network trained to predict dry biomass using approximate biomass labels and a small trusted dataset with gold standard labels. We design our approach on a herbage mass estimation dataset collected in Ireland and also report state-of-the-art results on the publicly released Grass-Clover biomass estimation demise from Denmark.

AB  - Grammar error correction systems are pivotal in the field of natural language processing (NLP), with a primary focus on identifying and correcting the grammatical integrity of written text. This is crucial for both language learning and formal communication. Recently, neural machine translation (NMT) has emerged as a promising approach in high demand. However, this approach faces significant challenges, particularly the scarcity of training data and the complexity of grammar error correction (GEC), especially for low-resource languages such as Indonesian. To address these challenges, we propose InSpelPoS, a confusion method that combines two synthetic data generation methods: the Inverted Spellchecker and Patterns+POS. Furthermore, we introduce an adapted seq2seq framework equipped with a dynamic decoding method and state-of-the-art Transformer-based neural language models to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of GEC. The dynamic decoding method is capable of navigating the complexities of GEC and correcting a wide range of errors, including contextual and grammatical errors. The proposed model leverages the contextual information of words and sentences to generate a corrected output. To assess the effectiveness of our proposed framework, we conducted experiments using synthetic data and compared its performance with existing GEC systems. The results demonstrate a significant improvement in the accuracy of Indonesian GEC compared to existing methods.

AB  - The evaluation of leachate leakage at livestock mortality burial sites is challenging, particularly when ground-water is previously contaminated by agro-livestock farming. Supervised machine learning was applied to discriminate the impacts of carcass leachate from pervasive groundwater contamination in the following order: data labeling, feature selection, synthetic data generation, and classification. Physicochemical data of 359 water samples were collected from burial pits (LC), monitoring wells near pits (MW), pre-existing shallow household wells (HW), and background wells with pervasive contamination (BG). A linear classification model was built using two representative groups (LC and BG) affected by different pollution sources as labeled data. A classifier was then applied to assess the impact of leachate leakage in MW and HW. As a result, leachate impacts were observed in 40% of MW samples, which indicates improper construction and management of some burial pits. Leachate impacts were also detected in six HW samples, up to 120 m downgradient, within one year. The quantitative decision-making tool to diagnose groundwater contamination with leachate leakage can contribute to ensuring timely responses to leakage. The proposed machine learning approach can also be used to improve the environmental impact assessment of water pollution by improper disposal of organic waste.

AB  - Synthetic medical image generation has evolved as a key technique for neural network training and validation. A core challenge, however, remains in the domain gap between simulations and real data. While deep learning-based domain transfer using Cycle Generative Adversarial Networks and similar architectures has led to substantial progress in the field, there are use cases in which state-of-the-art approaches still fail to generate training images that produce convincing results on relevant downstream tasks. Here, we address this issue with a domain transfer approach based on conditional invertible neural networks (cINNs). As a particular advantage, our method inherently guarantees cycle consistency through its invertible architecture, and network training can efficiently be conducted with maximum likelihood training. To showcase our method's generic applicability, we apply it to two spectral imaging modalities at different scales, namely hyperspectral imaging (pixel-level) and photoacoustic tomography (image-level). According to comprehensive experiments, our method enables the generation of realistic spectral data and outperforms the state of the art on two downstream classification tasks (binary and multi-class). cINN-based domain transfer could thus evolve as an important method for realistic synthetic data generation in the field of spectral imaging and beyond.

AB  - As data grow in quantity and complexity, data anonymization is becoming increasingly challenging. On one side, a great diversity of masking methods, synthetic data generation methods, and privacy models exists, and this diversity is often perceived as unsettling by practitioners. On the other side, most of the anonymization methodology was designed for static, structured, and small data, whereas the current landscape includes big data and, in particular, data streams. We explore here a unified and conceptually simple anonymization approach, by presenting a primitive called steered microaggregation that can be tailored to enforce various privacy models on static data sets and also on data streams. Steered microaggregation is based on adding artificial attributes that are properly initialized and weighted in order to guide the microaggregation process into meeting certain desired constraints. To demonstrate the potential of this type of microaggregation, we show how it can be used to achieve k-anonymity, t-closeness, l-diversity, and epsilon-differential privacy in the context of static data sets; furthermore, we discuss how it can be used to achieve k-anonymity of data streams while controlling tuple reordering. Beyond its flexibility and theoretical appeal, steered microaggregation can drastically reduce information loss, as shown by our experimental evaluation.

AB  - Software effort estimation (SEE) usually suffers from data scarcity problem due to the expensive or long process of data collection. As a result, companies usually have limited projects for effort estimation, causing unsatisfactory prediction performance. Few studies have investigated strategies to generate additional SEE data to aid such learning. We aim to propose a synthetic data generator to address the data scarcity problem of SEE. Our synthetic generator enlarges the SEE data set size by slightly displacing some randomly chosen training examples. It can be used with any SEE method as a data preprocessor. Its effectiveness is justified with 6 state-of-the-art SEE models across 14 SEE data sets. We also compare our data generator against the only existing approach in the SEE literature. Experimental results show that our synthetic projects can significantly improve the performance of some SEE methods especially when the training data is insufficient. When they cannot significantly improve the prediction performance, they are not detrimental either. Besides, our synthetic data generator is significantly superior or perform similarly to its competitor in the SEE literature. Therefore, our data generator plays a non-harmful if not significantly beneficial effect on the SEE methods investigated in this paper. Therefore, it is helpful in addressing the data scarcity problem of SEE.

AB  - The prevalence of ubiquitous location-aware devices and mobile Internet enables us to collect massive individual-level trajectory dataset from users. Such trajectory big data bring new opportunities to human mobility research but also raise public concerns with regard to location privacy. In this work, we present the Conditional Adversarial Trajectory Synthesis (CATS), a deep-learning-based GeoAI methodological framework for privacy-preserving trajectory data generation and publication. CATS applies K-anonymity to the underlying spatiotemporal distributions of human movements, which provides a distributional-level strong privacy guarantee. By leveraging conditional adversarial training on K-anonymized human mobility matrices, trajectory global context learning using the attention-based mechanism, and recurrent bipartite graph matching of adjacent trajectory points, CATS is able to reconstruct trajectory topology from conditionally sampled locations and generate high-quality individual-level synthetic trajectory data, which can serve as supplements or alternatives to raw data for privacy-preserving trajectory data publication. The experiment results on over 90k GPS trajectories show that our method has a better performance in privacy preservation, spatiotemporal characteristic preservation, and downstream utility compared with baseline methods, which brings new insights into privacy-preserving human mobility research using generative AI techniques and explores data ethics issues in GIScience.

AB  - In this work an integrated heath monitoring platform is proposed and developed for performance analysis and degradation diagnostics of gas turbine engines. The aim is to link engine measurable data to its health status.
   A numerical tool has been implemented in order to calculate engine performance in design condition and to create a database of expected vales. Then different degradation levels have been introduced in the two main components, compressor and turbine of a single spool turbojet and the diagnostics instruments have been trained to detect the component fault.
   In order to evaluate the performance prediction two different machine learning based techniques, namely, artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM) have been compared.
   Synthetic data generation has been carried out to show how the degradation effects can affect the engine performance. The two main degradation causes considered are the compressor fouling and turbine erosion.
   The machine learning techniques were applied with two aims: aero-engine performance prediction and health diagnostics. The study was carried out based on three samples flights, whose data were used for the training and testing process of the prediction and diagnostics tools.
   The knowledge and the continuous monitoring of the engine health status can be crucial for maintenance and fleet management operations. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Service-level mobile traffic data enables research studies and innovative applications with a potential to shape future service-oriented communication systems and beyond. However, real-world datasets reporting measurements at the individual service level are hard to access as such data is deemed commercially sensitive by operators. APPSHOT is a model for generating synthetic high-fidelity city-scale snapshots of service level mobile traffic. It can operate in any geographical region and relies solely on easily available spatial context information such as population density, thus allowing the generation of new and open traffic datasets for the research community. The design of APPSHOT is informed by an original characterization of service-level mobile traffic data. APPSHOT is a novel conditional GAN design instantiated by a convolutional neural network generator and two discriminators. The model features several other innovative mechanisms including multi-channel and overlapping patch based generation to address the unique challenges involved in generating mobile service traffic snapshots. Experiments with ground-truth data collected by a major European operator in multiple metropolitan areas show that APPSHOT can produce realistic network loads at the service level for areas where it has no prior traffic knowledge, and that such data can reliably support service-oriented networking studies.

AB  - Inspection of commerce entering the country is currently an onerous, custom and extremely labor-intensive process. The imaging of commerce with 2D x-rays aids the ability to interdict certain items entering the country, reducing risk and increasing national security. We use a variety of ML techniques together to develop automated threat recognition (ATR) algorithms to assist this process. The challenge is to develop a system that incorporates several approaches simultaneously and ensemble results to improve overall performance.
   We employ several algorithmic techniques to solve the problem. Generally, we have synthetic data generation techniques that can rapidly spin up datasets that are then employed to train ML models. GANs are used to refine the synthetic data to resemble reality more faithfully; thresholding objectively improves top line S/N; semi-supervised methods are used to handle data sparsity and leverage any available unlabeled stream of commerce (SOC) data. Suites of object detectors infer in parallel using common techniques and results are then ensembled using a novel graph-based method. Similarity and change detection along with topological data analysis may leverage historical data to investigate anomalies. This paper is an overview of our approach, generating synthetic data and attempting to unite these ML methods to provide the highest performance for ATR of 2D x-ray data.

AB  - Recent developments in mmWave technology allow the detection and classification of dynamic arm gestures. However, achieving a high accuracy and generalization requires a lot of samples for the training of a machine learning model. Furthermore, in order to capture variability in the gesture class, the participation of many subjects and the conduct of many gestures with different arm speed are required. In case of macro-gestures, the position of the subject must also vary inside the field of view of the device. This would require a significant amount of time and effort, which needs to be repeated in case that the sensor hardware or the modulation parameters are modified. In order to reduce the required manual effort, here we developed a synthetic data generator that is capable of simulating seven arm gestures by utilizing Blender, an open-source 3D creation suite. We used it to generate 600 artificial samples with varying speed of execution and relative position of the simulated subject, and used them to train a machine learning model. We tested the model using a real dataset recorded from ten subjects, using an experimental sensor. The test set yielded 84.2% accuracy, indicating that synthetic data generation can significantly contribute in the pre-training of a model.

AB  - Grammar error correction systems are pivotal in the field of natural language processing (NLP), with a primary focus on identifying and correcting the grammatical integrity of written text. This is crucial for both language learning and formal communication. Recently, neural machine translation (NMT) has emerged as a promising approach in high demand. However, this approach faces significant challenges, particularly the scarcity of training data and the complexity of grammar error correction (GEC), especially for low-resource languages such as Indonesian. To address these challenges, we propose InSpelPoS, a confusion method that combines two synthetic data generation methods: the Inverted Spellchecker and Patterns+POS. Furthermore, we introduce an adapted seq2seq framework equipped with a dynamic decoding method and state-of-the-art Transformer-based neural language models to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of GEC. The dynamic decoding method is capable of navigating the complexities of GEC and correcting a wide range of errors, including contextual and grammatical errors. The proposed model leverages the contextual information of words and sentences to generate a corrected output. To assess the effectiveness of our proposed framework, we conducted experiments using synthetic data and compared its performance with existing GEC systems. The results demonstrate a significant improvement in the accuracy of Indonesian GEC compared to existing methods.

AB  - Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have gained significant attention in several computer vision tasks for generating high-quality synthetic data. Various medical applications including diagnostic imaging and radiation therapy can benefit greatly from synthetic data generation due to data scarcity in the domain. However, medical image data is typically kept in 3D space, and generative models suffer from the curse of dimensionality issues in generating such synthetic data. In this paper, we investigate the potential of GANs for generating connected 3D volumes. We propose an improved version of 3D alpha-GAN by incorporating various architectural enhancements. On a synthetic dataset of connected 3D spheres and ellipsoids, our model can generate fully connected 3D shapes with similar geometrical characteristics to that of training data. We also show that our 3D GAN model can successfully generate high-quality 3D tumor volumes and associated treatment specifications (e.g., isocenter locations). Similar moment invariants to the training data as well as fully connected 3D shapes confirm that improved 3D alpha-GAN implicitly learns the training data distribution, and generates realistic-looking samples. The capability of improved 3D alpha-GAN makes it a valuable source for generating synthetic medical image data that can help future research in this domain.

AB  - An emerging area in data science that has lately gained attention is the virtual population (VP) and synthetic data generation. This field has the potential to significantly affect the healthcare industry by providing a means to augment clinical research databases that have a shortage of subjects. The current study provides a comparative analysis of five distinct approaches for creating virtual data populations from real patient data. The data set utilized for the current analyses involved clinical data collected among patients scheduled for elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). To that end, the five computational techniques employed to augment the given dataset were: (i) Tabular Preset, (ii) Gaussian Copula Model (iii) Generative Adversarial Network based (GAN) Deep Learning data synthesizer (CTGAN), (iv) a variation of the CTGAN Model (Copula GAN), and (v) VAE-based Deep Learning data synthesizer (TVAE). The performance of these techniques was assessed against their effectiveness in producing high-quality virtual data. For this purpose, dataset correlation matrices, cosine similarity distance, density histograms, and kernel density estimation are employed to perform a comparative analysis of each attribute and the respective synthetic equivalent. Our findings demonstrate that Gaussian Copula Model prevails in creating virtual data with consistent distributions (Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) and Chi-Squared (CS) tests equal to 0.9 and 0.98, respectively) and correlation patterns (average cosine similarity equals to 0.95).

AB  - Predicting early in treatment whether a tumor is likely to be responsive is a difficult yet important task to support clinical decision making. Studies have shown that multimodal biomarkers could provide complementary information and lead to more accurate treatment outcome prognosis than unimodal biomarkers. However, the prognosis accuracy could be affected by multimodal data heterogeneity and incompleteness. The small-sized and imbalance datasets also bring additional challenges for training a designed prognosis model. In this study, a modular framework employing multimodal biomarkers for cancer treatment outcome prediction was proposed. It includes four modules of synthetic data generation, deep feature extraction, multimodal feature fusion, and classification to address the challenges described above. The feasibility and advantages of the designed framework were demonstrated through an example study, in which the goal was to stratify oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) patients with low and high risks of treatment failures by use of the positron emission tomography (PET) image data and microRNA (miRNA) biomarkers. The superior prognosis performance and the comparison with other methods demonstrated the efficiency of the proposed framework and its ability of enabling seamless integration, validation, and comparison of various algorithms in each module of the framework. The limitation and future work were discussed as well.

AB  - In recent years, large pretrained models have been used in dialogue systems to improve successful task completion rates. However, lack of reasoning capabilities of dialogue platforms make it difficult to provide relevant and fluent responses, unless the designers of a conversational experience spend a considerable amount of time implementing these capabilities in external rule based modules. In this work, we propose a novel method to fine-tune pretrained transformer models such as Roberta and T5, to reason over a set of facts in a given dialogue context. Our method includes a synthetic data generation mechanism which helps the model learn logical relations, such as comparison between list of numerical values, inverse relations (and negation), inclusion and exclusion for categorical attributes, and application of a combination of attributes over both numerical and categorical values, and spoken form for numerical values, without need for additional training data. We show that the transformer based model can perform logical reasoning to answer questions when the dialogue context contains all the required information, otherwise it is able to extract appropriate constraints to pass to downstream components (e.g. a knowledge base) when partial information is available. We observe that transformer based models such as UnifiedQA-T5 can be fine-tuned to perform logical reasoning (such as numerical and categorical attributes' comparison) over attributes seen at training time (e.g., accuracy of 90%+ for comparison of smaller than k(max)=5 values over heldout test dataset).

AB  - Variational autoencoders (VAEs) are artificial neural networks used to learn effective data encodings in an unsupervised manner. Each input x provided to a VAE is indeed mapped to an internal representation, say z, in a low-dimensional space, called the latent space, from which an approximate version x of x can be eventually reconstructed via a decoding phase. VAEs are very popular generative models because, by randomly sampling points from the latent space, we can generate novel and unseen data that still reflect the characteristics of the dataset used for the training. In many application domains, however, generating random instances is not enough. Rather, we would like mechanisms that can generate instances enjoying some high-level features that are desired by the users. To accomplish this goal, a novel VAE architecture -named Feature Driven VAE is-presented. Internally, it uses Gaussian Mixture Models to structure the latent space into meaningful partitions, and it allows us to generate data with any desired combination of features, even when that specific combination has been never seen in the training examples. The architecture is orthogonal to the underlying application domain. However, to show its practical effectiveness, a specialization to the case of image generation has been presented and implemented. Results of experimental activity conducted on top of it are eventually discussed.

AB  - High-dimensional data visualization has been attracting much attention. To fully test related software and algorithms, researchers require a diverse pool of data with known and desired features. Test data do not always provide this, or only partially. Here we propose the paradigm WYDIWYGS (What You Draw Is What You Get). Its embodiment, SketchPad(ND), is a tool that allows users to generate high-dimensional data in the same interface they also use for visualization. This provides for an immersive and direct data generation activity, and furthermore it also enables users to interactively edit and clean existing high-dimensional data from possible artifacts. SketchPad(ND) offers two visualization paradigms, one based on parallel coordinates and the other based on a relatively new framework using an N-D polygon to navigate in high-dimensional space. The first interface allows users to draw arbitrary profiles of probability density functions along each dimension axis and sketch shapes for data density and connections between adjacent dimensions. The second interface embraces the idea of sculpting. Users can carve data at arbitrary orientations and refine them wherever necessary. This guarantees that the data generated is truly high-dimensional. We demonstrate our tool's usefulness in real data visualization scenarios.

AB  - The problem of imbalanced data between classes prevails in various applications such as bioinformatics. The correctness of prediction in case of imbalanced data is usually biased towards the majority class. However, in several applications, the accuracy of prediction in minority class is also significant as much as in majority class. Previously, there were many techniques proposed to increase the accuracy in minority class. These techniques are based on the concept of re-sampling, which can be over-sampling and under-sampling, during the training process. Those re-sampling techniques did not considered how the data are scattered in the space. In this paper, we proposed a new technique based on the fact that the location of separating function in between any two sub-clusters in different classes is defined only by the boundary data of each sub-cluster. In addition, the accuracy is measured only by the testing set. Our technique adapted the concept of bootstrapping to estimate new region of each sub-cluster and synthesize the new boundary data. The new region is for coping with the unseen testing data. All new synthesized data were classified by using the concept of AdaBoost algorithm. Our results outperformed the other techniques under several performance evaluating functions. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Accurate predictive modeling is often hindered by the prevalent issue of class imbalance within weather-related crash datasets. To address this critical challenge, this study introduces a novel and tailored synthetic data generation technique aimed at effectively handling nominal predictors specific to weather-related crash cases in North Carolina. Data treatment techniques such as the synthetic minority over-sampling technique-nominal (SMOTE-N) and adaptive synthetic-nominal (ADASYN-N) were investigated in this study. A comprehensive comparison of these data treatment techniques is conducted using two prominent machine learning models: the bagging algorithm (random forest [RF]) and the boosting algorithm (extreme gradient boosting [XGBoost]). The findings indicate that the effectiveness of data treatment varies with the severity level and the algorithm used. The ADASYN-N technique was observed to be highly effective for severe and moderate injury crash prediction using both the RF and XGBoost models, while the control dataset and SMOTE-N demonstrated notable performance in property damage only crash prediction using both the RF and XGBoost models. The findings from evaluating the performance of these models with data treatment methods serve as a benchmark for practitioners in selecting appropriate synthetic sample generation techniques, consequently facilitating the development of more accurate crash severity prediction models and contributing to enhanced traffic safety strategies.

AB  - In the last few years, energy efficiency has become a challenge. Not only mitigating environmental impact but reducing energy waste can lead to financial advantages. Buildings play an important role in this: they are among the biggest consumers. So, finding manners to reduce energy consumption is a way to minimise energy waste, and a technique for that is creating Demand Response (DR) strategies. This paper proposes a novel way to decrease computational effort of simulating the behaviour of a building using surrogate models based on active learning. Before going straight to the problem of a building, which is complex and computationally costly, the paper proposes the approach of active learning to a smaller problem: with reduced simulations, regress the curve of voltage versus current of a thermo-resistor. Then, the paper implements a surrogate model of energy consumption of a building. The goal is to be able to learn the consumption pattern based on a limited number of simulations. The result given by the surrogate can be used to set the reference temperature, maximising the PV self-consumption, and reducing energy usage from the grid. Thanks to the surrogate, the total time spent to map all possible consumption scenarios is reduced around 7 times.

AB  - Instead of taking images with a camera, synthetic data is generated in a computer simulation. One advantage of this is that training data can be generated on-demand, e.g., to automatically retrain robots when a task changes. While this makes synthetic data a promising approach for autonomous productions, realizing such autonomous setups is difficult with current systems for generating synthetic data, which usually require a programmer for every dataset to be generated.
   To overcome this problem, we present a novel framework for generating synthetic data. This framework restructures the generation process into asynchronous phases to increase the level of autonomy in two ways. First, by letting programmers write parameterized scripts, many different datasets can be autonomously generated. Secondly, by introducing a user interface, domain experts are enabled to influence the generation process on their own without a programmer. Furthermore, by being built as a new layer on top of existing systems for generating synthetic data, our framework shows a new way to maximize compatibility with other research on synthetic data generation.
   To test our framework, we have developed a fully functional prototype based on it. Successfully using this prototype for an example experiment, we conclude that our ideas work. Future research can use our prototype for more elaborate experiments on autonomous productions and to further assess its usability.

AB  - Physiological signals are commonly the result of complex interactions between systems and organs, these interactions lead to signals that exhibit a non-stationary behaviour. For cardiac signals, non-stationary heart rate variability (HRV) may produce misinterpretations. A previous work proposed to divide a non-stationary signal into stationary segments by looking for changes in the signal's properties related to changes in the mean of the signal. In this paper, we extract stationary segments from non-stationary synthetic and cardiac signals. For synthetic signals with di ff erent signal-to-noise ratio levels, we detect the beginning and end of the stationary segments and the result is compared to the known values of the occurrence of these events. For cardiac signals, RR interval (cardiac cycle length) time series, obtained from electrocardiographic records during stress tests for two populations (diabetic patients with cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy and control subjects), were divided into stationary segments. Results on synthetic signals reveal that the non-stationary sequence is divided into more stationary segments than needed. Additionally, due to HRV reduction and exercise intolerance reported on diabetic cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy patients, non-stationary RR interval sequences from these subjects can be divided into longer stationary segments compared to the control group.

AB  - This article presents GenSQL, a probabilistic programming system for querying probabilistic generative models of database tables. By augmenting SQL with only a few key primitives for querying probabilistic models, GenSQL enables complex Bayesian inference workflows to be concisely implemented. GenSQL's query planner rests on a unified programmatic interface for interacting with probabilistic models of tabular data, which makes it possible to use models written in a variety of probabilistic programming languages that are tailored to specific workflows. Probabilistic models may be automatically learned via probabilistic program synthesis, hand-designed, or a combination of both. GenSQL is formalized using a novel type system and denotational semantics, which together enable us to establish proofs that precisely characterize its soundness guarantees. We evaluate our system on two case real-world studies-an anomaly detection in clinical trials and conditional synthetic data generation for a virtual wet lab-and show that GenSQL more accurately captures the complexity of the data as compared to common baselines. We also show that the declarative syntax in GenSQL is more concise and less error-prone as compared to several alternatives. Finally, GenSQL delivers a 1.7-6.8x speedup compared to its closest competitor on a representative benchmark set and runs in comparable time to hand-written code, in part due to its reusable optimizations and code specialization.

AB  - The innovation process for the management of a Water Distribution Network (WDN) in a Smart City starts from an efficient digital representation of the network itself. This paper presents a new visualization tool for WDN that overcomes current challenges and provides water companies with useful managing information. Existing visualization tools are self-contained systems that work independently from other visualization software and do not provide real-time analysis of the pipes and water flow status in the WDN. Using digital maps such as Google Maps it is possible to extend the traditional digital representation of the WDN based on EPANET software. Moreover, the WDN representation can be enriched with localized information (e.g. roads or buildings superimposed on the WDN), that is useful for planning maintenance and structural services. In presence of a WDN equipped with sensors and flowmeters, the proposed tool can be used for optimized visualization of the flow rate and the condition of the pipes in real-time. For these reasons, this tool can be a powerful instrument to help technicians quickly identify problems in the WDN. In this work, we used synthetic data generation techniques to obtain a data-set of values that updated over time. Finally, to evaluate the designed solution, we implemented the proposed visualization tool and performed some experiments to test its effectiveness.

AB  - Deep neural networks achieve state-of-the-art results in various classification and synthetic data generation tasks. However, only little is known about why depth improves a model. We investigate the structure of stochastic deep neural works, also known as Deep Boltzmann Machines, to shed some light on this issue. While the best known results postulate an exponential dependence between the number of visible units and the depth of the model, we show that the required depth is upper bounded by the longest path in the underlying junction tree, which is at most linear in the number of visible units. Moreover, we show that the conditional independence structure of any categorical Deep Boltzmann Machine contains a sub-tree that allows the consistent estimation of the full joint probability mass function of all visible units. We connect our results to l(1)-regularized maximum-likelihood estimation and Chow-Liu trees. Based on our theoretical findings, we present a new tractable version of Deep Boltzmann Machines, namely the Deep Boltzmann Tree (DBT). We provide a hyper-parameter-free algorithm for learning the DBT from data, and propose a new initialization method to enforce convergence to good solutions. Our findings provide some theoretical evidence for why a deep model might be beneficial. Experimental results on benchmark data show, that the DBT is a theoretical sound alternative to likelihood-free generative models.

AB  - In a high wind penetration scenario in electricity production, the availability of models for synthetically generating hourly wind speed data becomes increasingly important for both sizing and modeling integrated renewable systems. A methodology for generating hourly wind speed time series is presented in this paper, adopting a physical-statistical approach based on some known aggregate input data. The proposed approach, developed in a previous study by the same authors, has been here improved using a new diurnal wind speed profile function. The improved methodology is first described and validated through experimental wind speed data, comparing the results with those obtained using the basic model. Then, hourly wind speeds generated with the improved methodology are used as input data for the optimal design of grid-connected and off-grid wind power plants. For each configuration, the influence of the diurnal wind speed profile and wind regime on system sizing and its economic parameters has been evaluated. Results have shown that the diurnal variation of wind speed does not affect the size of wind turbine, but strongly influences the storage capacity of off-grid wind power plants.

AB  - Machine learning techniques are attractive options for developing highly-accurate analysis tools for nanomaterials characterization, including high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). However, successfully implementing such machine learning tools can be difficult due to the challenges in procuring sufficiently large, high-quality training datasets from experiments. In this work, we introduce Construction Zone, a Python package for rapid generation of complex nanoscale atomic structures which enables fast, systematic sampling of realistic nanomaterial structures and can be used as a random structure generator for large, diverse synthetic datasets. Using Construction Zone, we develop an end-to-end machine learning workflow for training neural network models to analyze experimental atomic resolution HRTEM images on the task of nanoparticle image segmentation purely with simulated databases. Further, we study the data curation process to understand how various aspects of the curated simulated data-including simulation fidelity, the distribution of atomic structures, and the distribution of imaging conditions-affect model performance across three benchmark experimental HRTEM image datasets. Using our workflow, we are able to achieve state-of-the-art segmentation performance on these experimental benchmarks and, further, we discuss robust strategies for consistently achieving high performance with machine learning in experimental settings using purely synthetic data. Construction Zone and its documentation are available at https://github.com/lerandc/construction_zone.

This is crucial for both language learning and formal communication. Recently, neural machine translation (NMT) has emerged as a promising approach in high demand. However, this approach faces significant challenges, particularly the scarcity of training data and the complexity of grammar error correction (GEC), especially for low-resource languages such as Indonesian. To address these challenges, we propose InSpelPoS, a confusion method that combines two synthetic data generation methods: the Inverted Spellchecker and Patterns+POS. Furthermore, we introduce an adapted seq2seq framework equipped with a dynamic decoding method and state-of-the-art Transformer-based neural language models to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of GEC. The dynamic decoding method is capable of navigating the complexities of GEC and correcting a wide range of errors, including contextual and grammatical errors. The proposed model leverages the contextual information of words and sentences to generate a corrected output. To assess the effectiveness of our proposed framework, we conducted experiments using synthetic data and compared its performance with existing GEC systems. The results demonstrate a significant improvement in the accuracy of Indonesian GEC compared to existing methods.

AB  - This paper presents a set of effective approaches to handle extremely low-resource language pairs for self-attention based neural machine translation (NMT) focusing on English and four Asian languages. Starting from an initial set of parallel sentences used to train bilingual baseline models, we introduce additional monolingual corpora and data processing techniques to improve translation quality. We describe a series of best practices and empirically validate the methods through an evaluation conducted on eight translation directions, based on state-of-the-art NMT approaches such as hyper-parameter search, data augmentation with forward and backward translation in combination with tags and noise, as well as joint multilingual training. Experiments show that the commonly used default architecture of self-attention NMT models does not reach the best results, validating previous work on the importance of hyper-parameter tuning. Additionally, empirical results indicate the amount of synthetic data required to efficiently increase the parameters of the models leading to the best translation quality measured by automatic metrics. We show that the best NMT models trained on large amount of tagged back-translations outperform three other synthetic data generation approaches. Finally, comparison with statistical machine translation (SMT) indicates that extremely low-resource NMT requires a large amount of synthetic parallel data obtained with back-translation in order to close the performance gap with the preceding SMT approach.

AB  - In this paper we investigate the use of deep neural networks for 3D object detection in uncommon, unstructured environments such as in an open-pit mine. While neural nets are frequently used for object detection in regular autonomous driving applications, more unusual driving scenarios aside street traffic pose additional challenges. For one, the collection of appropriate data sets to train the networks is an issue. For another, testing the performance of trained networks often requires tailored integration with the particular domain as well. While there exist different solutions for these problems in regular autonomous driving, there are only very few approaches that work for special domains just as well. We address both the challenges above in this work. First, we discuss two possible ways of acquiring data for training and evaluation. That is, we evaluate a semi-automated annotation of recorded LIDAR data and we examine synthetic data generation. Using these datasets we train and test different deep neural network for the task of object detection. Second, we propose a possible integration of a ROS2 detector module for an autonomous driving platform. Finally, we present the performance of three state-of-the-art deep neural networks in the domain of 3D object detection on a synthetic dataset and a smaller one containing a characteristic object from an open-pit mine.

AB  - Machine Learning (ML)-based models are steadily gaining popularity. Their performance is determined from the amount and the quality of data used at their inputs, as well as from the competence and proper tuning of the ML algorithm used. However, collecting high-quality real data is time-consuming and expensive. Synthetic Data Generation (SDG) is therefore employed in order to augment the limited real data. Moreover, Ensemble Learning (EL) provides the framework to optimally combine a set of standalone ML algorithms (base learners), capitalizing on their individual strengths. Base learner diversity is essential to build a strong ensemble. The proposed method of Targeted Injection of Synthetic Data (TIoSD) combines the EL and SDG concepts in order to further diversify the base learners' predictions, thus giving rise to an even stronger ensemble model. We have applied TIoSD in two different Path Loss (PL) datasets, using two well-established SDG methods (namely SMOGN and CTGAN). While the conventional ensemble model reached a Minimum Absolute Error (MAE) value of 3.25 dB, the TIoSD-triggered ensemble provided a MAE value of 3.16 dB. It is therefore concluded that targeted synthetic data injection, due to its diversity-triggering characteristics, enhances the ensemble's performance. Moreover, the ratio between synthetic and real data has been investigated. The results showed that a proportion of 0.1 is optimal.

AB  - High-Level Synthesis (HLS) Design Space Exploration (DSE) is a widely accepted approach for efficiently exploring Pareto-optimal and optimal hardware solutions during the HLS process. Several HLS benchmarks and datasets are available for the research community to evaluate their methodologies. Unfortunately, these resources are limited and may not be sufficient for complex, multi-component system-level explorations. Generating new data using existing HLS benchmarks can be cumbersome, given the expertise and time required to effectively generate data for different HLS designs and directives. As a result, synthetic data has been used in prior work to evaluate system-level HLS DSE. However, the fidelity of the synthetic data to real data is often unclear, leading to uncertainty about the quality of system-level HLS DSE. This paper proposes a novel approach, called Vaegan, that employs generative machine learning to generate synthetic data that is robust enough to support complex system-level HLS DSE experiments that would be unattainable with only the currently available data. We explore and adapt a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for this task and evaluate our approach using state-of-the-art datasets and metrics. We compare our approach to prior works and show that Vaegan effectively generates synthetic HLS data that closely mirrors the ground truth's distribution.

AB  - Automatic post-editing (APE) refers to a research field that aims to automatically correct errors included in the translation sentences derived by the machine translation system. This study has several limitations, considering the data acquisition, because there is no official dataset for most language pairs. Moreover, the amount of data is restricted even for language pairs in which official data has been released, such as WMT. To solve this problem and promote universal APE research regardless of APE data existence, this study proposes a method for automatically generating APE data based on a noising scheme from a parallel corpus. Particularly, we propose a human mimicking errors-based noising scheme that considers a practical correction process at the human level. We propose a precise inspection to attain high performance, and we derived the optimal noising schemes that show substantial effectiveness. Through these, we also demonstrate that depending on the type of noise, the noising scheme-based APE data generation may lead to inferior performance. In addition, we propose a dynamic noise injection strategy that enables the acquisition of a robust error correction capability and demonstrated its effectiveness by comparative analysis. This study enables obtaining a high performance APE model without human-generated data and can promote universal APE research for all language pairs targeting English.

AB  - One common issue with datasets used for supervised classification tasks is data imbalance or the unequal distribution of classes within a dataset. The class imbalance may cause biased machine learning models to favor the dominant class, misclassifying the minority class. Specific techniques can be employed to deal with the issue of class imbalance, including resampling by oversampling or undersampling and ensemble approaches. Besides, generative adversarial networks, a deep learning technique for building generative models, offer an alternative machine learning technique that is particularly well suited to address the class imbalance problem. This work introduces a machine learning-based approach to deal with the class imbalance in a cancer intracellular signaling dataset produced by a verified and validated computer simulation. Specifically, we use synthetic data generation to increase and balance the dataset generated by the computational simulation. The used approach simulates the oversampling method by employing a generative adversarial network to produce new examples for the minority class. Subsequently, we applied supervised machine learning methods, such as the K-NN algorithm, to assess whether or not the classification accuracy improved relative to the unbalanced dataset. The results presented in this work have shown an accuracy increase in the classification of patterns belonging to the minority class, with an improvement of 24.5%.

AB  - Neural style transfer is a powerful computer vision technique that can incorporate the artistic "style" of one image to the "content" of another. The underlying theory behind the approach relies on the assumption that the style of an image is represented by the Gram matrix of its features, which is typically extracted from pre-trained convolutional neural networks (e.g., VGG-19). This idea does not straightforwardly extend to time series stylization since notions of style for two-dimensional images are not analogous to notions of style for one-dimensional time series. In this work, a novel formulation of time series style transfer is proposed for the purpose of synthetic data generation and enhancement. We introduce the concept of stylized features for time series, which is directly related to the time series realism properties, and propose a novel stylization algorithm, called StyleTime, that uses explicit feature extraction techniques to combine the underlying content (trend) of one time series with the style (distributional properties) of another. Further, we discuss evaluation metrics, and compare our work to existing state-of-the-art time series generation and augmentation schemes. To validate the effectiveness of our methods, we use stylized synthetic data as a means for data augmentation to improve the performance of recurrent neural network models on several forecasting tasks.

AB  - The class imbalance problem, in which the distribution of different classes in training data is unequal or skewed, is a prevailing problem. This can lead to classifier algorithms being biased, negatively impacting the performance of the minority class. In this paper, we addressed the class imbalance problem in datasets for aspect-based sentiment classification. Aspect-based Sentiment Classification (AbSC) is a type of fine-grained sentiment analysis in which sentiments about particular aspects of an entity are extracted. In this work, we addressed the issue of class imbalance by creating synthetic data. For synthetic data generation, two techniques have been proposed: paraphrasing using the PEGASUS fine-tuned model and backtranslation using the M2M100 neural machine translation model. We compared these techniques with two other class balancing techniques, such as weighted oversampling and cross-entropy loss with class weight. An extensive experimental study has been conducted on three benchmark datasets for restaurant reviews: SemEval-2014, SemEval-2015, and SemEval-2016. We applied these methods to the BERT-based deep learning model for aspect-based sentiment classification and studied the effect of balancing the data on the performance of these models. Our proposed balancing technique, using synthetic data, yielded better results than the other two existing methods for dealing with multi-class imbalance.

AB  - The generation of synthetic data is becoming a fundamental task in the daily life of any organization due to the new protection data laws that are emerging. Because of the rise in the use of Artificial Intelligence, one of the most recent proposals to address this problem is the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). These types of networks have demonstrated a great capacity to create synthetic data with very good performance. The goal of synthetic data generation is to create data that will perform similarly to the original dataset for many analysis tasks, such as classification. The problem of GANs is that in a classification problem, GANs do not take class labels into account when generating new data, it is treated as any other attribute. This research work has focused on the creation of new synthetic data from datasets with different characteristics with a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN). CGANs are an extension of GANs where the class label is taken into account when the new data is generated. The performance of our results has been measured in two different ways: firstly, by comparing the results obtained with classification algorithms, both in the original datasets and in the data generated; secondly, by checking that the correlation between the original data and those generated is minimal.

AB  - As the amount of additive manufactured parts is rising methods for part defect detection are needed to guarantee good product quality and fulfill quality management requirements. The usage of deep learning methods in industrial environments for artefact detection is growing, therefore, it is crucial to obtain enough training data in order to deploy powerful models for intelligent control systems. We propose a novel approach for synthetic image creation for object defect detection of Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) manufactured parts based on deep learning methods and demonstrate the capability to enhance deep learning based defect detection with synthetic images. Our approach is based on physical rendering in combination with a generative adversarial network (GAN) for synthetic data generation. We illustrate how the generated synthetic images can be used to enhance deep learning methods by training an autoencoder model which afterwards is used for failure detection. By an evaluation study it is depicted that our approach for synthetic image generation achieves good results where, in comparison to real world images nearly the same amount of images are assumed to be real. Using the advantage of synthetic data, the autoencoder model is able to detect failures in real images. Therefore, the approach is able to generate photo realistic images which can be used to detect defects on parts with limited training material.

AB  - We propose a synthetic image method named local-foreground generative adversarial networks for surface defect detection in the industry. The method comprises three contributions: First, in order to provide more training data, an algorithm that generates full synthetic images of defects is proposed. The method may blend the defect samples stored in the different mobile terminal into existing background images of the production environment in a natural way, accounting for both geometry and appearance. Second, the diversity of defects appearance is increased due to the use of deep convolutional generative adversarial networks only for local-foreground and the defect edge details that are preserved by introducing a guided filter in the process of image synthesis. Third, the image fusion method can adapt to the various production environment of different brightness and camera angles, which has strong adaptability and expansion ability. We also discuss the experimental results of synthetic data on an end-to-end detection system based on deep learning. As we know, YOLO detector trained on synthetic data achieving average precision of 95.2% on test dataset, which is 12.5% higher than heuristic data augmentation individually. Furthermore, it can process 23 images/s on 1080Ti GPU, which meets the requirements for real-time industrial inspection. (C) 2020 SPIE and IS&T

AB  - We show, for the first time, that neural networks trained only on synthetic data achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on the problem of 3D human pose and shape (HPS) estimation from real images. Previous synthetic datasets have been small, unrealistic, or lacked realistic clothing. Achieving sufficient realism is non-trivial and we show how to do this for full bodies in motion. Specifically, our BEDLAM dataset contains monocular RGB videos with ground-truth 3D bodies in SMPL-X format. It includes a diversity of body shapes, motions, skin tones, hair, and clothing. The clothing is realistically simulated on the moving bodies using commercial clothing physics simulation. We render varying numbers of people in realistic scenes with varied lighting and camera motions. We then train various HPS regressors using BEDLAM and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on real-image benchmarks despite training with synthetic data. We use BEDLAM to gain insights into what model design choices are important for accuracy. With good synthetic training data, we find that a basic method like HMR approaches the accuracy of the current SOTA method (CLIFF). BEDLAM is useful for a variety of tasks and all images, ground truth bodies, 3D clothing, support code, and more are available for research purposes. Additionally, we provide detailed information about our synthetic data generation pipeline, enabling others to generate their own datasets. See the project page: https://bedlam.is.tue.mpg.de/.

AB  - The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and in particular modern machine learning (ML) algorithms during the last decade has been met with great interest in the agricultural industry. While undisputedly powerful, their main drawback remains the need for sufficient and diverse training data. The collection of real datasets and their annotation are the main cost drivers of ML developments, and while promising results on synthetically generated training data have been shown, their generation is not without difficulties on their own. In this paper, we present a development model for the iterative, cost-efficient generation of synthetic training data. Its application is demonstrated by developing a low-cost early disease detector for tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum) using synthetic training data. A neural classifier is trained by exclusively using synthetic images, whose generation process is iteratively refined to obtain optimal performance. In contrast to other approaches that rely on a human assessment of similarity between real and synthetic data, we instead introduce a structured, quantitative approach. Our evaluation shows superior generalization results when compared to using non-task-specific real training data and a higher cost efficiency of development compared to traditional synthetic training data. We believe that our approach will help to reduce the cost of synthetic data generation in future applications.

AB  - We propose an approach utilizing gamma-distributed random variables, coupled with log-Gaussian modeling, to generate synthetic datasets suitable for training neural networks. This addresses the challenge of limited real observations in various applications. We apply this methodology to both Raman and coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) spectra, using experimental spectra to estimate gamma process parameters. Parameter estimation is performed using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, yielding a full Bayesian posterior distribution for the model which can be sampled for synthetic data generation. Additionally, we model the additive and multiplicative background functions for Raman and CARS with Gaussian processes. We train two Bayesian neural networks to estimate parameters of the gamma process which can then be used to estimate the underlying Raman spectrum and simultaneously provide uncertainty through the estimation of parameters of a probability distribution. We apply the trained Bayesian neural networks to experimental Raman spectra of phthalocyanine blue, aniline black, naphthol red, and red 264 pigments and also to experimental CARS spectra of adenosine phosphate, fructose, glucose, and sucrose. The results agree with deterministic point estimates for the underlying Raman and CARS spectral signatures.

AB  - Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have garnered considerable interest as a viable replacement for conventional silicon-based solar cells, thanks to their high-power conversion efficiency (PCE), low manufacturing costs, and ease of adjusting optoelectronic properties. To expedite the development of PSC devices, it is crucial to establish seamless connections between relevant parameters, thereby saving time and reducing the costs associated with actual experimentation. This capability can be achieved through advanced machine learning (ML) models, which are at the forefront of providing such interrelation capabilities. In this investigation, a comprehensive ML pipeline using scientific data from PSCs is established, which includes data processing methods and synthetic data generation. Various ML models such as linear, logic-tree-based, gradient-based, discriminative-based, and attention-based neural network regressors are utilized to predict PCE of PSCs. The results indicate that the XG-Boost ML algorithm displays a minimum mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.52, while the attention-based neural network model TabNet also demonstrates an MAE as low as 1.62. Furthermore, the coefficient of determination for these models is as high as 0.919 and 0.915, respectively. The findings and developed models can aid in the study of training and evaluation processes and provide insights into correlations within perovskite data for required property prediction.

AB  - Aortic stenosis occurs when the aortic valve does not fully open during the systole, which reduces and partially blocks the blood flow to the systemic circulation. The clinical diagnosis and treatment decision depend on the functional severity of the stenosis, which is assessed based on the trans-valvular peak pressure drop. The pressure drop is routinely estimated analytically, which may lead to sub-optimal results since certain hemodynamic aspects are not fully captured, like pressure recovery or blood flow turbulence. A promising solution lies in the use of machine learning (ML) for estimating the pressure drop based on patient-specific characteristics. Although a ML-based solution could provide the desired results in real time, the training of an accurate neural network would require a large database of invasively measured pressure drops, which is difficult and costly to set up. This study introduces a method for generating synthetic datasets based on a generic aortic valve model. This model is customized in order to create diverse yet physiologically normal valve shapes by modifying three anatomical parameters, namely the aorta diameter, blood velocity and valve area, by reducing it. High-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were conducted to compute reference pressure drop values. The efficacy of the generated dataset was assessed by employing it for training an ML model for pressure drop estimation.

AB  - Recent advances in neuromorphic algorithm development have shown that neural inspired architectures can efficiently solve scientific computing problems including graph decision problems and partial-integro differential equations (PIDEs). The latter requires the generation of a large number of samples from a stochastic process. While the Monte Carlo approximation of the solution of the PIDEs converges with an increasing number of sampled neuromorphic trajectories, the fidelity of samples from a given stochastic process using neuromorphic hardware requires verification. Such an exercise increases our trust in this emerging hardware and works toward unlocking its energy and scaling efficiency for scientific purposes such as synthetic data generation and stochastic simulation.
   In this paper, we focus our verification efforts on a one-dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic differential equation. Using a discrete-time Markov chain approximation, we sample trajectories of the stochastic process across a variety of parameters on an Intel 8-Loihi chip Nahuku neuromorphic platform. Using relative entropy as a verification measure, we demonstrate that the random samples generated on Loihi are, in an average sense, acceptable. Finally, we demonstrate how Loihi's fidelity to the distribution changes as a function of the parameters of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck equation, highlighting a trade-off between the lower-precision random number generation of the neuromorphic platform and our algorithm's ability to represent a discrete-time Markov chain.

AB  - Real-time Transient Stability Assessment (TSA) is essential for prompt control decisions that lead to a stable power system. With the wide deployment of Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) in power grids, data-driven TSA approaches, particularly those based on machine learning (ML) techniques, have become increasingly relevant in recent years. Within cycles, the well-trained ML-based TSA classifiers enable accurately assessing the post-fault transient stability of a power system. However, events that lead to transient instability are rare. Hence, the training datasets used by ML-based classifiers are highly imbalanced, challenging the accuracy of these methods. An imbalanced dataset, where the number of unstable samples is significantly lower than the number of stable samples, will result in an inaccurate and biased classifier. To address the problem of imbalanced data, the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is utilized to generate synthetic unstable datasets by learning from the real unstable transient data, with a goal to balance the distribution of the stable and unstable datasets. To learn the spatial and temporal correlations of the PMU data, a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and the correlation loss are utilized to construct the GAN model. Comparison with other data resampling methods demonstrates that the developed GAN model addresses the problem of an imbalanced training dataset, and results in more accurate machine learning-based algorithms for TSA.

AB  - Tabular data, organized like tables with rows and columns, is widely used. Existing models for tabular data synthesis often face limitations related to data size or complexity. In contrast, deep generative models, a part of deep learning, demonstrate proficiency in handling large and complex data sets. While these models have shown remarkable success in generating image and audio data, their application in tabular data synthesis is relatively new, lacking a comprehensive comparison with existing methods. To fill this gap, this study aims to systematically evaluate and compare the performance of deep generative models with these existing methods for tabular data synthesis, while also investigating the efficacy of post-processing techniques. We aim to identify strengths and limitations and provide insights for future research and practical applications. Our study showed that the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and its variants outperform deep generative models, especially for small datasets. However, we observed that an ensemble of deep generative models and post-generation processing performs better on large datasets than SMOTE alone. The results of our study indicate that deep generative models hold promise as a valuable tool for generating tabular data. Nonetheless, further research is warranted to enhance the performance of deep generative models and gain a comprehensive understanding of their limitations.

AB  - Understanding map queries and retrieving correct entity results are the two main relevance tasks in Map search. They are usually performed by a set of task specific machine learning models. Collecting large amount of high quality labelled data for training such models is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. Although various methods have been studied for producing pseudo data labels, they are limited in their effectiveness when applied across different languages or tasks. The recently released Large Language models (LLMs), including ChatGPT and GPT-4 (GPT for short), have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in text understanding by using simple prompt instructions with only a handful of examples for in-context learning. In this paper, we explore GPT as a cost-effective alternative for both data labeling and synthetic data generation, where we subsequently use data obtained from this approach to train various task specific models such as maps intent detection, address detection, address parsing, geo-entity ranking, and rank scores calibration. GPT demonstrates strong potential in generating otherwise hard-to-synthesize data. We observe significant accuracy and relevance improvement across all task specific models when trained or fine-tuned on data generated by GPT. Lastly, we propose a general framework combining labeled data from GPT with other sources and a prompt fine-tune structure to guide GPT model in completing a given task.

AB  - Induced polarization (IP) measurements are affected by various types of noise, which should be removed prior to data interpretation. However, existing data processing methods often rely on empirical assumptions about the standard shape of IP decay curves. Our goal is to introduce a data-driven approach for modeling and processing time-domain IP measurements. To reach this goal, we train a variational autoencoder (VAE) on 1,600,319 IP decays collected in Canada, the United States, and Kazakhstan. The proposed deep learning approach is unsupervised and avoids the pitfalls of IP parameterization with empirical Cole-Cole and Debye decomposition models, simple power-law models, or mechanistic models. Four applications of VAEs are key to modeling and processing IP data (1) synthetic data generation, (2) Bayesian denoising, (3) evaluation of signal-to-noise ratio, and (4) outlier detection. Furthermore, we interpret the IP data compilation's latent representation and reveal a correlation between its fast dimension and the average chargeability. Finally, we determine that a single real-valued scalar parameter contains sufficient information to encode IP data. This new finding suggests that modeling time-domain IP data using mathematical models governed by more than one free parameter is ambiguous, whereas modeling only the average chargeability is justified. A pretrained implementation of the VAE model is available as open-source Python code.

AB  - Computer-aided diagnosis using dermoscopy images is a promising technique for improving the efficiency of facial skin disorder diagnosis and treatment. Hence, in this study, we propose a low-level laser therapy (LLLT) system with a deep neural network and medical internet of things (MIoT) assistance. The main contributions of this study are to (1) provide a comprehensive hardware and software design for an automatic phototherapy system, (2) propose a modified-U(2)Net deep learning model for facial dermatological disorder segmentation, and (3) develop a synthetic data generation process for the proposed models to address the issue of the limited and imbalanced dataset. Finally, a MIoT-assisted LLLT platform for remote healthcare monitoring and management is proposed. The trained U-2-Net model achieved a better performance on untrained dataset than other recent models, with an average Accuracy of 97.5%, Jaccard index of 74.7%, and Dice coefficient of 80.6%. The experimental results demonstrated that our proposed LLLT system can accurately segment facial skin diseases and automatically apply for phototherapy. The integration of artificial intelligence and MIoT-based healthcare platforms is a significant step toward the development of medical assistant tools in the near future.

AB  - We propose a new probabilistic programming language for the design and analysis of perception systems, especially those based on machine learning. Specifically, we consider the problems of training a perception system to handle rare events, testing its performance under different conditions, and debugging failures. We show how a probabilistic programming language can help address these problems by specifying distributions encoding interesting types of inputs and sampling these to generate specialized training and test sets. More generally, such languages can be used for cyber-physical systems and robotics to write environment models, an essential prerequisite to any formal analysis. In this paper, we focus on systems like autonomous cars and robots, whose environment is a scene, a configuration of physical objects and agents. We design a domain-specific language, Scenic, for describing scenarios that are distributions over scenes. As a probabilistic programming language, Scenic allows assigning distributions to features of the scene, as well as declaratively imposing hard and soft constraints over the scene. We develop specialized techniques for sampling from the resulting distribution, taking advantage of the structure provided by Scenic's domain-specific syntax. Finally, we apply Scenic in a case study on a convolutional neural network designed to detect cars in road images, improving its performance beyond that achieved by state-of-the-art synthetic data generation methods.

AB  - The complex mechanical response of open-cell foams depends strongly on the hierarchy of length scales inherent in them, from engineering-part scale to the ligament scale through the grain scale down to the crystal-lattice scale. A first step toward understanding and predicting the coordinated mechanical response across length scales requires characterizing the open-cell foam structure in three dimensions at relevant scales. Here, we present an initial attempt to digitally represent a physically-realized aluminum alloy foam in terms of both its geometry/topology as well as its underlying crystallographic orientations by integrating several advanced techniques. Specifically, we use a combination of X-ray computed tomography and X-ray diffraction microscopy in conjunction with synthetic grain mapping. Experimental investigation of the foam shows relatively large grain sizes with respect to the ligament length scale, implying that competing mechanics at different length scales (i.e. grain scale vs. ligament scale) will need to be fully incorporated to understand the mechanical behavior of the foam. The integration of non-destructive measurement techniques with synthetic-data generation provides a path toward realistic modeling of bulk samples of open-cell metal foam resolved at the scale of individual grains.

AB  - Deep learning-based models, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), have been applied to various sequence learning tasks with great success. Following this, these models are increasingly replacing classic approaches in object tracking applications for motion prediction. On the one hand, these models can capture complex object dynamics with less modeling required, but on the other hand, they depend on a large amount of training data for parameter tuning. Towards this end, we present an approach for generating synthetic trajectory data of unmanned-aerial-vehicles (UAVs) in image space. Since UAVs, or rather quadrotors are dynamical systems, they can not follow arbitrary trajectories. With the prerequisite that UAV trajectories fulfill a smoothness criterion corresponding to a minimal change of higher-order motion, methods for planning aggressive quadrotors flights can be utilized to generate optimal trajectories through a sequence of 3D waypoints. By projecting these maneuver trajectories, which are suitable for controlling quadrotors, to image space, a versatile trajectory data set is realized. To demonstrate the applicability of the synthetic trajectory data, we show that an RNN-based prediction model solely trained on the generated data can outperform classic reference models on a real-world UAV tracking dataset. The evaluation is done on the publicly available ANTI-UAV dataset.

AB  - A critical limitation in the application of deep learning to radar signal classification is the lack of sufficient data to train very deep neural networks. The depth of a neural network is one of the more significant network parameters that affects achievable classification accuracy. One way to overcome this challenge is to generate synthetic samples for training deep neural networks (DNNs). In prior work of the authors, two methods have been developed: 1) diversified micro-Doppler signature generation via transformations of the underlying skeletal model derived from video motion capture (MOCAP) data, and 2) auxiliary conditional generative adversarial networks (ACGANs) with kinematic sifting. While diversified MOCAP has the advantage of greater accuracy in generating signatures that span to the probable target space of expected human motion for different body sizes, speeds, and individualized gait, the method cannot capture data artifacts due to sensor imperfections or clutter. In contrast, adversarial learning has been shown to be able to capture non-target related artifacts, however, the ACGANs can also generate misleading signatures that are kinematically impossible. This paper provides an in-depth performance comparison of the two methods on a through-the-wall radar data set of human activities of daily living (ADL) in the presence of clutter and sensor artifacts.

AB  - This study attests to the benefits of synthetic data generation with the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), and it incorporates this procedure with SMOTEBoosting by applying learning algorithms to model unbalanced catastrophic out-of-pocket (OOP) health expenditure dataset. Nationally representative household budget survey data were gathered from Turkish Statistical Institute for the year 2012. A total of 9987 households responded to the survey. The original dataset was highly unbalanced and a total of 0.14% of households faced catastrophic health expenses. SMOTE was used to perform balanced oversampling, and 10 artificial datasets with sizes from 10% to 100% of the majority group of original training data were generated. To predict OOP catastrophic health expenditures, the SMOTEBoosting was embedded with learning algorithms, such as C5.0, random forest (RF), naive Bayes, and support vector machine. Study results confirm the outstanding prediction performance of the blended strategy of SMOTEBoosting with RF (area under the curve > 0.85) for prediction. A variable importance plot and decision tree visualise that at least 65 years of age is the most important predictor of the catastrophic cases. The findings of this study highlight that multistrategy ensemble learning techniques are useful to model highly unbalanced datasets.

AB  - Medical imaging diagnosis increasingly relies on Machine Learning (ML) models. This is a task that is often hampered by severely imbalanced datasets, where positive cases can be quite rare. Their use is further compromised by their limited interpretability, which is becoming increasingly important. While post-hoc interpretability techniques such as SHAP and LIME have been used with some success on so-called black box models, the use of inherently understandable models makes such endeavours more fruitful. This paper addresses these issues by demonstrating how a relatively new synthetic data generation technique, STEM, can be used to produce data to train models produced by Grammatical Evolution (GE) that are inherently understandable. STEM is a recently introduced combination of the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), Edited Nearest Neighbour (ENN), and Mixup; it has previously been successfully used to tackle both between-class and within-class imbalance issues. We test our technique on the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) and the Wisconsin Breast Cancer (WBC) datasets and compare Area Under the Curve (AUC) results with an ensemble of the top three performing classifiers from a set of eight standard ML classifiers with varying degrees of interpretability. We demonstrate that the GE-derived models present the best AUC while still maintaining interpretable solutions.

AB  - The accurate and reliable fault diagnosis of air handling units (AHUs) has profound impacts on building energy efficiency and indoor thermal comforts. Data-driven fault diagnosis methods have gained increasing popularity considering the wide availabilities of operational data and advances in data analytics. In practice, the data-driven fault diagnosis performance can be severely degraded by the imbalanced nature of building operational data, i.e., the data samples of faulty operations are much smaller than that of normal operations. This study serves as a comprehensive study to investigate the potential of different data synthesis techniques in enhancing the performance of imbalanced AHU fault diagnosis. A variety of data synthesis strategies, ranging from conventional random sampling-based to advanced variational autoencoder-based techniques, have been developed for synthetic data generation. Data experiments have been designed to quantitatively evaluate the value of data synthesis in data scenarios considering various data amounts and imbalanced ratios. The research results indicate that synthetic data can significantly enhance the performance of imbalanced AHU fault diagnosis by up to 8.94%. Optimal data synthesis strategies have been identified in different data scenarios.

AB  - To support the mission of providing safe electricity generation with a high capacity factor, a Predictive Maintenance (PdM) framework using Machine Learning Models (MLM) to optimize component maintenance operations is developed. Using sensor measurements to better predict the true component's Remaining Useful Life (RUL), the PdM framework has the potential to optimize maintenance costs by performing maintenance only when necessary. The PdM framework to pump bearings, the framework consists of a Convolutional Neural Network Autoencoder (CNN-AE) to detect component deviations from normality, a CNN to characterize component fault modes, and a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) to estimate the component RUL with uncertainty. To increase the number of training samples, a synthetic data generation procedure was developed and includes procedures to recreate the fault-specific characteristic frequencies for diagnostics and the degradation trends for prognostics. The MLMs trained on the synthetic data are tested on the Center for Intelligent Maintenance Systems (IMS) dataset to showcase how well the synthetic data replicates measurement data. Utilizing this framework, the PdM was found to delay maintenance on average by a total of 8.92 years over 40 years and decrease the unexpected component failure rate from 10% to 0% when compared to traditional maintenance philosophies.

AB  - We present a novel deep neural model for text detection in document images. For robust text detection in noisy scanned documents, the advantages of multi-task learning are adopted by adding an auxiliary task of text enhancement. Namely, our proposed model is designed to perform noise reduction and text region enhancement as well as text detection. Moreover, we enrich the training data for the model with synthesized document images that are fully labeled for text detection and enhancement, thus overcome the insufficiency of labeled document image data. For the effective exploitation of the synthetic and real data, the training process is separated in two phases. The first phase is training only synthetic data in a fully-supervised manner. Then real data with only detection labels are added in the second phase. The enhancement task for the real data is weakly-supervised with information from their detection labels. Our methods are demonstrated in a real document dataset with performances exceeding those of other text detection methods. Moreover, ablations are conducted and the results confirm the effectiveness of the synthetic data, auxiliary task, and weak-supervision. Whereas the existing text detection studies mostly focus on the text in scenes, our proposed method is optimized to the applications for the text in scanned documents.

AB  - Wiki articles are created and maintained by a crowd of editors, producing a continuous stream of reviews. Reviews can take the form of additions, reverts, or both. This crowdsourcing model is exposed to manipulation since neither reviews nor editors are automatically screened and purged. To protect articles against vandalism or damage, the stream of reviews can be mined to classify reviews and profile editors in real-time. The goal of this work is to anticipate and explain which reviews to revert. This way, editors are informed why their edits will be reverted. The proposed method employs stream-based processing, updating the profiling and classification models on each incoming event. The profiling uses side and content-based features employing Natural Language Processing, and editor profiles are incrementally updated based on their reviews. Since the proposed method relies on self-explainable classification algorithms, it is possible to understand why a review has been classified as a revert or a non-revert. In addition, this work contributes an algorithm for generating synthetic data for class balancing, making the final classification fairer. The proposed online method was tested with a real data set from Wikivoyage, which was balanced through the aforementioned synthetic data generation. The results attained near-90% values for all evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure).

AB  - Generating synthetic datasets is an innovative approach for data dissemination. Values at risk of disclosure or even the entire dataset are replaced with multiple draws from statistical models. The quality of the released data strongly depends on the ability of these models to capture important relationships found in the original data. Defining useful models for complex survey data can be difficult and cumbersome. One possible approach to reduce the modeling burden for data disseminating agencies is to rely on machine learning tools to reveal important relationships in the data.
   This paper contains an initial investigation to evaluate whether support vector machines could be utilized to develop synthetic datasets. The application is limited to categorical data but extensions for continuous data should be straight forward. I briefly describe the concept of support vector machines and necessary adjustments for synthetic data generation. I evaluate the performance of the suggested algorithm using a real dataset, the JAB Establishment Panel. The results indicate that some data utility improvements might be achievable using support vector machines. However, these improvements come at the price of an increased disclosure risk compared to standard parametric modeling and more research is needed to find ways for reducing the risk. Some ideas for achieving this goal are provided in the discussion at the end of the paper.

AB  - The greatest challenge when using deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) for automatic segmentation of microstructural X-ray computed tomography (XCT) data is the acquisition of sufficient and relevant data to train the working network. Traditionally, these have been attained by manually annotating a few slices for 2D DCNNs. However, complex multiphase microstructures would presumably be better segmented with 3D networks. However, manual segmentation labeling for 3D problems is prohibitive. In this work, we introduce a method for generating synthetic XCT data for a challenging six-phase Al-Si alloy composite reinforced with ceramic fibers and particles. Moreover, we propose certain data augmentations (brightness, contrast, noise, and blur), a special in-house designed deep convolutional neural network (Triple UNet), and a multi-view forwarding strategy to promote generalized learning from synthetic data and therefore achieve successful segmentations. We obtain an overall Dice score of 0.77. Lastly, we prove the detrimental effects of artifacts in the XCT data on achieving accurate segmentations when synthetic data are employed for training the DCNNs. The methods presented in this work are applicable to other materials and imaging techniques as well. Successful segmentation coupled with neural networks trained with synthetic data will accelerate scientific output.

AB  - Lithium-ion batteries undergo capacity loss and power fade over time. Despite indicating degradation, these changes lack internal insights. Degradation modes group various mechanisms but are challenging to quantify due to aging complexity. In this paper, a noninvasive and comprehensive diagnostic framework is proposed for the accurate estimation of the state of health (SOH) and degradation modes. A large amount of synthetic data is generated from the mechanistic model to cover many typical aging paths without using redundant experimental data. A data-driven multistep diagnosis method is developed by using incremental capacity sequences. This method analyses unique sensitivities to voltage responses from different degradation modes and identifies them sequentially to simplify complex interactions. In addition, overpotential correction is incorporated to estimate battery degradation modes under normal usage. This framework is validated through experimental data under various operating conditions, affirming the 2 % accuracy of SOH estimation and the effective automatic quantification of degradation modes. Furthermore, the method is applicable to common state-of-charge (SOC) windows ranging from 25% to 85 % (3.6 V-4.1 V for the voltage window) and a high current rate up to C/4. The diagnostic framework does not rely on any regular calibration data during model training and thus has high potential for practical application.

AB  - The accurate reconstruction of a defective part of the mandible is a time-consuming task in maxillofacial surgery. In order to design accurate 3D implants quickly, a method for generating a mandibular defect implant model based on deep learning was proposed. First, an algorithm for generating a defective mandible 3D model randomly from a complete mandible 3D model was proposed due to the insufficiency of 3D models. Then a mandible 3D model dataset that consists of defective mandible 3D models and a complete mandible 3D model was constructed. An improved 3D Unet network that combines residual structure and dilated convolution was designed to generate a repaired mandibular model automatically. Finally, a mandibular defect implant model was generated using the reconstruction-subtraction strategy and was validated on the constructed dataset. Compared with the other three networks (3D Unet, 3D RUnet, and 3D DUnet), the proposed method obtained the best results. The Dice, IoU, PPV, and Recall for mandible repair reached 0.9873, 0.9750, 0.9850, and 0.9897, respectively, while those for implants reached 0.8018, 0.6731, 0.7782, and 0.8330. Statistical analysis was carried out on the experimental results. Compared with other methods, the P value of the method proposed in this paper was less than 0.05 for most indicators, which is a significant improvement.

AB  - Progress has been achieved recently in object detection given advancements in deep learning. Nevertheless, such tools typically require a large amount of training data and significant manual effort to label objects. This limits their applicability in robotics, where solutions must scale to a large number of objects and variety of conditions. This work proposes an autonomous process for training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) fir object detection and pose estimation in robotic setups. The focus is on detecting objects placed in cluttered, tight environments, such as a shelf with multiple objects. In particular, given access to 31) object models, several aspects of the environment are physically simulated. The models arc placed in physically realistic poses with respect to their environment to generate a labeled synthetic dataset. To further improve object detection, the network self-trains over real images that are labeled using a robust multi-view pose estimation process. The proposed training process is evaluated on several existing datasets and on a dataset collected for this paper with a Motoman robotic arm. Results show that the proposed approach outperforms popular training processes relying on synthetic - but not physically realistic-data and manual annotation. The key contributions are the incorporation of physical reasoning in the synthetic data generation process and the automation of the annotation process over real images.

AB  - In maritime logistics, mathematical optimization and simulation are widely-used methods for solving planning problems and evaluating solutions. When putting these solutions to test, extensive and reliable data are urgently needed but constantly scarce. Since comprehensive real-life data are often not available or are classified as sensitive business data, synthetic data generation is a beneficial way to rectify this deficiency. Even institutions which already own comprehensive container flow data are dependent on synthetic data, due to the need to adapt and test their business models to uncertain future developments. A synthetic data generator that creates incoming and outgoing containers from the perspective of a maritime container terminal has already been proposed. However, since its publication more than 15 years have passed and the industry has changed. This justifies to rethink, rework, and improve the existing solution. This paper presents a synthetic container flow generator which allows the user to create synthetic but yet realistic data of container flows for maritime container terminals. After the introduction and motivation, this paper provides an overview about the state of the art of synthetic data generators. Then, the conceptual model of the generator is presented. Furthermore, an exemplary visual validation of the generated output data is shown. The paper closes with a discussion and outlook on planned future developments of the software.

AB  - Background: Synthetic data generation (SDG) based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) is used in health care, but research on preserving data with logical relationships with synthetic tabular data (STD) remains challenging. Filtering methods for SDG can lead to the loss of important information.Objective: This study proposed a divide-and-conquer (DC) method to generate STD based on the GAN algorithm, while preserving data with logical relationships.Methods: The proposed method was evaluated on data from the Korea Association for Lung Cancer Registry (KALC-R) and 2 benchmark data sets (breast cancer and diabetes). The DC-based SDG strategy comprises 3 steps: (1) We used 2 different partitioning methods (the class-specific criterion distinguished between survival and death groups, while the Cramer V criterion identified the highest correlation between columns in the original data); (2) the entire data set was divided into a number of subsets, which were then used as input for the conditional tabular generative adversarial network and the copula generative adversarial network to generate synthetic data; and (3) the generated synthetic data were consolidated into a single entity. For validation, we compared DC-based SDG and conditional sampling (CS)-based SDG through the performances of machine learning models. In addition, we generated imbalanced and balanced synthetic data for each of the 3 data sets and compared their performance using 4 classifiers: decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and light gradient-boosting machine (LGBM) models.Results: The synthetic data of the 3 diseases (non-small cell lung cancer [NSCLC], breast cancer, and diabetes) generated by our proposed model outperformed the 4 classifiers (DT, RF, XGBoost, and LGBM). The CS-versus DC-based model performances were compared using the mean area under the curve (SD) values: 74.87 (SD 0.77) versus 63.87 (SD 2.02) for NSCLC, 73.31 (SD 1.11) versus 67.96 (SD 2.15) for breast cancer, and 61.57 (SD 0.09) versus 60.08 (SD 0.17) for diabetes (DT); 85.61 (SD 0.29) versus 79.01 (SD 1.20) for NSCLC, 78.05 (SD 1.59) versus 73.48 (SD 4.73) for breast cancer, and 59.98 (SD 0.24) versus 58.55 (SD 0.17) for diabetes (RF); 85.20 (SD 0.82) versus 76.42 (SD 0.93) for NSCLC, 77.86 (SD 2.27) versus 68.32 (SD 2.37) for breast cancer, and 60.18 (SD 0.20) versus 58.98 (SD 0.29) for diabetes (XGBoost); and 85.14 (SD 0.77) versus 77.62 (SD 1.85)for NSCLC, 78.16 (SD 1.52) versus 70.02 (SD 2.17) for breast cancer, and 61.75 (SD 0.13) versus 61.12 (SD 0.23) for diabetes (LGBM). In addition, we found that balanced synthetic data performed better. Conclusions: This study is the first attempt to generate and validate STD based on a DC approach and shows improved performance using STD. The necessity for balanced SDG was also demonstrated.

AB  - Objective: The early prediction of preterm labor can significantly minimize premature delivery complications for both the mother and infant. The aim of this research is to propose an automatic algorithm for the prediction of preterm labor using a single electrohysterogram (EHG) signal. Method: The proposed method firstly employs empirical mode decomposition (EMD) to split the EHG signal into two intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), then extracts sample entropy (SampEn), the root mean square (RMS), and the mean Teager-Kaiser energy (MTKE) from each IMF to form the feature vector. Finally, the extracted features are fed to a k-nearest neighbors (kNN), support vector machine (SVM), and decision tree (DT) classifiers to predict whether the recorded EHG signal refers to the preterm case. Main results: The studied database consists of 262 term and 38 preterm delivery pregnancies, each with three EHG channels, recorded for 30 min. The SVM with a polynomial kernel achieved the best result, with an average sensitivity of 99.5%, a specificity of 99.7%, and an accuracy of 99.7%. This was followed by DT, with a mean sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 98.4%, and an accuracy of 98.7%. Significance: The main superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art algorithms that studied the same database is the use of only a single EHG channel without using either synthetic data generation or feature ranking algorithms.

AB  - In this paper, we present ClinicaDL, an open-source software platform that aims at enhancing the reproducibility and rigor of research for deep learning in neuroimaging. We first provide an overview of the software platform and then focus on recent advances. Features of the software aim at addressing three key issues in the field: the lack of reproducibility, the methodological flaws that plague many published studies and the difficulties using neuroimaging datasets for people with little expertise in this application area. Key existing functionalities include automatic data splitting, checking for data leakage, standards for data organization and results storing, continuous integration and integration with Clinica for preprocessing, amongst others. The most prominent recent features are as follows. We now provide various data augmentation and synthetic data generation functions (both standard and advanced ones including motion and hypometabolism simulation). Continuous integration test data are now versioned using DVC (data version control). Tools for generating validation splits have been made more generic. We made major improvements regarding usability and performance. We now support multi-GPU training and automatic mixed precision (to exploit tensor cores). We created a graphical interface to easily generate training specifications. We allow tracking of experiments through standard tools (MLflow, Weights&Biases). We believe that ClinicaDL can contribute to enhance the trustworthiness of research in deep learning for neuroimaging. Moreover, its functionalities and coding practices may serve as inspiration for the whole medical imaging community, beyond neuroimaging.

AB  - The use of synthetic data is gaining an increasingly prominent role in data and machine learning workflows to build better models and conduct analyses with greater statistical inference. In the domains of healthcare and biomedical research, synthetic data may be seen in structured and unstructured formats. Concomitant with the adoption of synthetic data, a sub-discipline of machine learning known as deep learning has taken the world by storm. At a larger scale, deep learning methods tend to outperform traditional methods in regression and classification tasks. These techniques are also used in generative modeling and are thus prime candidates for generating synthetic data in both structured and unstructured formats. Here, we emphasize the generation of synthetic data in healthcare and biomedical research using deep learning methods for unstructured data formats such as text and images. Deep learning methods leverage the neural network algorithm, and in the context of generative modeling, several neural network architectures can create new synthetic data for a problem at hand including, but not limited to, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), variational autoencoders (VAEs), and generative adversarial networks (GANs). To better understand these methods, we will look at specific case studies such as generating realistic clinical notes of a patient, the generation of synthetic DNA sequences, as well as to enrich experimental data collected during the study of heterotypic cultures of cancer cells.

AB  - Background COVID-19 is a novel virus that affects the upper respiratory tract, as well as the lungs. The scale of the global COVID-19 pandemic, its spreading rate, and deaths are increasing regularly. Computed tomography (CT) scans can be used carefully to detect and analyze COVID-19 cases. In CT images/scans, ground-glass opacity (GGO) is found in the early stages of infection. While in later stages, there is a superimposed pulmonary consolidation. Methods This research investigates the quantum machine learning (QML) and classical machine learning (CML) approaches for the analysis of COVID-19 images. The recent developments in quantum computing have led researchers to explore new ideas and approaches using QML. The proposed approach consists of two phases: in phase I, synthetic CT images are generated through the conditional adversarial network (CGAN) to increase the size of the dataset for accurate training and testing. In phase II, the classification of COVID-19/healthy images is performed, in which two models are proposed: CML and QML. Result The proposed model achieved 0.94 precision (Pn), 0.94 accuracy (Ac), 0.94 recall (Rl), and 0.94 F1-score (Fe) on POF Hospital dataset while 0.96 Pn, 0.96 Ac, 0.95 Rl, and 0.96 Fe on UCSD-AI4H dataset. Conclusion The proposed method achieved better results when compared to the latest published work in this domain.

AB  - Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for human action recognition, yet their reliance on vast amounts of high-quality labeled data poses significant challenges. The traditional approach of collecting and labeling large volumes of real-world data is not only costly but also raises ethical concerns. A promising alternative is to generate synthetic data. However, the existing synthetic data generation pipelines require complex simulation environments. Our work presents a novel solution by employing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate synthetic yet realistic training data from a small existing real-world dataset, thereby bypassing the need for elaborate simulation environments. Central to our approach is a training pipeline that extracts motion from each training video and augments it across varied subject appearances within the training set. This method increases the diversity in both motion and subject representation, thus significantly enhancing the model's performance in accurately recognizing human gestures. The model's performance is rigorously evaluated in diverse scenarios, including ground and aerial views, to demonstrate the method's versatility and effectiveness. The findings of our study highlight the efficiency of GAN-based data augmentation, utilizing a minimal real dataset to create synthetic data without relying on complex simulators. Moreover, useful insights are provided by analyzing the critical factors influencing gesture recognition performance, such as the diversity in gesture motion and the diversity in subject appearance.

AB  - In the recent past, deep learning-based models have achieved tremendous success in computer vision-related tasks with the help of large-scale annotated datasets. An interesting application of deep learning is synthetic data generation, especially in the domain of medical image analysis. The need for such a task arises due to the scarcity of original data. Class imbalance is another reason for applying data augmentation techniques. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are beneficial for synthetic image generation in various fields. However, stand-alone GANs may only fetch the localized features in the latent representation of an image, whereas combining different GANs might understand the distributed features. To this end, we have proposed AGGrGAN, an aggregation of three base GAN models-two variants of Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) and a Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) to generate synthetic MRI scans of brain tumors. Further, we have applied the style transfer technique to enhance the image resemblance. Our proposed model efficiently overcomes the limitation of data unavailability and can understand the information variance in multiple representations of the raw images. We have conducted all the experiments on the two publicly available datasets - the brain tumor dataset and the Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge (BraTS) 2020 dataset. Results show that the proposed model can generate fine-quality images with maximum Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) scores of 0.57 and 0.83 on the said two datasets.

AB  - Functional brain networks represent dynamic and complex interactions among anatomical regions of interest (ROIs), providing crucial clinical insights for neural pattern discovery and disorder diagnosis. In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have proven immense success and effectiveness in analyzing structured network data. However, due to the high complexity of data acquisition, resulting in limited training resources of neuroimaging data, GNNs, like all deep learning models, suffer from overfitting. Moreover, their capability to capture useful neural patterns for downstream prediction is also adversely affected. To address such challenge, this study proposes BrainSTEAM, an integrated framework featuring a spatio-temporal module that consists of an EdgeConv GNN model, an autoencoder network, and a Mixup strategy. In particular, the spatio-temporal module aims to dynamically segment the time series signals of the ROI features for each subject into chunked sequences. We leverage each sequence to construct correlation networks, thereby increasing the training data. Additionally, we employ the EdgeConv GNN to capture ROI connectivity structures, an autoencoder for data denoising, and mixup for enhancing model training through linear data augmentation. We evaluate our framework on two real-world neuroimaging datasets, ABIDE for Autism prediction and HCP for gender prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority and robustness of BrainSTEAM when compared to a variety of existing models, showcasing the strong potential of our proposed mechanisms in generalizing to other studies for connectome-based fMRI analysis.

AB  - We propose a novel framework to train models to classify acceptability of responses generated by natural language generation (NLG) models, improving upon existing sentence transformation and model-based approaches. An NLG response is considered acceptable if it is both semantically correct and grammatical. We don't make use of any human references making the classifiers suitable for run-time deployment. Training data for the classifiers is obtained using a 2-stage approach of first generating synthetic data using a combination of existing and new model-based approaches followed by a novel validation framework to filter and sort the synthetic data into acceptable and unacceptable classes. Our 2-stage approach adapts to a wide range of data representations and does not require additional data beyond what the NLG models are trained on. It is also independent of the underlying NLG model architecture, and is able to generate more realistic samples close to the distribution of the NLG model-generated responses. We present results on 5 datasets (WebNLG, Cleaned E2E, ViGGO, Alarm, and Weather) with varying data representations. We compare our framework with existing techniques that involve synthetic data generation using simple sentence transformations and/or model-based techniques, and show that building acceptability classifiers using data that resembles the generation model outputs followed by a validation framework outperforms the existing techniques, achieving state-of-the-art results. We also show that our techniques can be used in few-shot settings using self-training.

AB  - Synthetic data generation describes the process of learning the underlying distribution of a given real dataset in a model, which is, in turn, sampled to produce new data objects still adhering to the original distribution. This approach often finds application where circumstances limit the availability or usability of real-world datasets, for instance, in health care due to privacy concerns. While image synthesis has received much attention in the past, time series are key for many practical (e.g., industrial) applications. To date, numerous different generative models and measures to evaluate time series syntheses have been proposed. However, regarding the defining features of high-quality synthetic time series and how to quantify quality, no consensus has yet been reached among researchers. Hence, we propose a comprehensive survey on evaluation measures for time series generation to assist users in evaluating synthetic time series. For one, we provide brief descriptions or - where applicable - precise definitions. Further, we order the measures in a taxonomy and examine applicability and usage. To assist in the selection of the most appropriate measures, we provide a concise guide for fast lookup. Notably, our findings reveal a lack of a universally accepted approach for an evaluation procedure, including the selection of appropriate measures. We believe this situation hinders progress and may even erode evaluation standards to a "do as you like"-approach to synthetic data evaluation. Therefore, this survey is a preliminary step to advance the field of synthetic data evaluation.

AB  - The accurate analysis of microscopy images representing various materials obtained in scanning probe microscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy, is in general time consuming as it requires the inspection of multiple data bases for the correct interpretation of the observed crystal structures. This task is especially demanding in microscopy video analysis involving a vast amount of image data. The recent development of deep learning (DL) algorithms has paved the way for cutting-edge microscopy studies in materials science, often outperforming conventional image analysis methods. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art in DL-based synthetic data generation, materials structure identification, three-dimensional structural reconstruction, and physical properties evaluation for different types of microscopy images. First, the fundamental concepts of DL relevant to materials science applications are reviewed. Subsequently, the combined experimental measurements and numerical simulations for preparing dedicated microscopy image for DL analysis are discussed. Then, the review concentrates on the core topic of the paper, that is the critical assessment of DL advances in materials' structural and physical properties evaluation. We believe that the future development and deployment of DL for practical microscopy data analysis will rely on the progress and improvement of advanced algorithms and innovative methods for training data generation.

AB  - Machine Learning (ML) methods have become important for enhancing the performance of decision-support predictive models. However, class imbalance is one of the main challenges for developing ML models, because it may bias the learning process and the model generalization ability. In this paper, we consider oversampling methods for generating synthetic categorical clinical data aiming to improve the predictive performance in ML models, and the identification of risk factors for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). We performed a comparative study of several categorical synthetic data generation methods, including Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique Nominal (SMOTEN), Tabular Variational Autoencoder (TVAE) and Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks (CTGANs). Then, we assessed the impact of combining oversampling strategies and linear and nonlinear supervised ML methods. Lastly, we conducted a post-hoc model interpretability based on the importance of the risk factors. Experimental results show the potential of GAN-based models for generating high-quality categorical synthetic data, yielding probability mass functions that are very close to those provided by real data, maintaining relevant insights, and contributing to increasing the predictive performance. The GAN-based model and a linear classifier outperform other oversampling techniques, improving the area under the curve by 2%. These results demonstrate the capability of synthetic data to help with both determining risk factors and building models for CVD prediction.

AB  - The existing work has conducted in-depth research and analysis on global differential privacy (GDP) and local differential privacy (LDP) based on information theory. However, the data privacy preserving community does not systematically review and analyze GDP and LDP based on the information-theoretic channel model. To this end, we systematically reviewed GDP and LDP from the perspective of the information-theoretic channel in this survey. First, we presented the privacy threat model under information-theoretic channel. Second, we described and compared the information-theoretic channel models of GDP and LDP. Third, we summarized and analyzed definitions, privacy-utility metrics, properties, and mechanisms of GDP and LDP under their channel models. Finally, we discussed the open problems of GDP and LDP based on different types of information-theoretic channel models according to the above systematic review. Our main contribution provides a systematic survey of channel models, definitions, privacy-utility metrics, properties, and mechanisms for GDP and LDP from the perspective of information-theoretic channel and surveys the differential privacy synthetic data generation application using generative adversarial network and federated learning, respectively. Our work is helpful for systematically understanding the privacy threat model, definitions, privacy-utility metrics, properties, and mechanisms of GDP and LDP from the perspective of information-theoretic channel and promotes in-depth research and analysis of GDP and LDP based on different types of information-theoretic channel models.

AB  - Large amounts of data have become an essential requirement in the development of modern computer vision algorithms, e.g. the training of neural networks. Due to data protection laws, overflight permissions for UAVs or expensive equipment, data collection is often a costly and time-consuming task. Especially, if the ground truth is generated by manually annotating the collected data. By means of synthetic data generation, large amounts of image- and metadata can be extracted directly from a virtual scene, which in turn can be customized to meet the specific needs of the algorithm or the use-case. Furthermore, the use of virtual objects avoids problems that might arise due to data protection issues and does not require the use of expensive sensors. In this work we propose a framework for synthetic test data generation utilizing the Unreal Engine. The Unreal Engine provides a simulation environment that allows one to simulate complex situations in a virtual world, such as data acquisition with UAVs or autonomous diving. However, our process is agnostic to the computer vision task for which the data is generated and, thus, can be used to create generic datasets. We evaluate our framework by generating synthetic test data, with which a CNN for object detection as well as a V-SLAM algorithm are trained and evaluated. The evaluation shows that our generated synthetic data can be used as an alternative to real data.

AB  - Mobile health (mHealth) applications have experienced rapid growth, driven by the demand for health monitoring solutions and smartphone adoption. However, evaluating these apps poses challenges due to limited and diverse user data. This study explores the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate synthetic test data for mHealth applications. The paper introduces the methodology involved in training GANs using real user data obtained from Google Fitbit and showcases the creation of synthetic data mirroring real user profiles and parameters. Statistical comparisons between real and synthetic datasets validate the alignment and similarities in key attributes such as age, BMI, and exercise duration. The paper elucidates the importance of user-centered design methodologies and the role of test data in mHealth app evaluation. User personas and diverse user scenarios are incorporated, showcasing the efficacy of synthetic data in mitigating data limitations. The study emphasizes the potential of synthetic test data to enhance the evaluation and validation of mHealth applications, providing a pathway to address data scarcity challenges. Future research avenues are outlined, including expanding user diversity, refining GAN models, and assessing the impact of synthetic data on machine learning models within mHealth apps. The study advocates for ethical considerations and privacy safeguards in synthetic data generation and usage, suggesting frameworks for responsible implementation. This research contributes to advancing mHealth application testing methodologies by leveraging GANs to create diverse and reliable synthetic test data.

AB  - We introduce localization convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a data-driven time series-based angle of arrival (AOA) localization scheme capable of coping with noise and errors in AOA estimates measured at receiver nodes. Our localization CNNs enhance their robustness by using a time series of AOA measurements rather than a single-time instance measurement to localize mobile nodes. We analyze real-world noise models, and use them to generate synthetic training data that increase the CNN's tolerance to noise. This synthetic data generation method replaces the need for expensive data collection campaigns to capture noise conditions in the field. The proposed scheme is both simple to use and also lightweight, as the mobile node to be localized solely transmits a beacon signal and requires no further processing capabilities. Our scheme is novel in its use of: (1) CNNs operating on space-time AOA images composed of AOA data from multiple receiver nodes over time, and (2) synthetically-generated perturbed training examples obtained via modeling triangulation patterns from noisy AOA measurements. We demonstrate that a relatively small CNN can achieve state-of-the-art localization accuracy that meets the 5G standard requirements even under high degrees of AOA noise. We motivate the use of our proposed localization CNNs with a tracking application for mobile nodes, and argue that our solution is advantageous due to its high localization accuracy and computational efficiency.

AB  - Spatial frequency domain imaging (SFDI) is well established in biology and medicine for non-contact, wide-field imaging of optical properties and 3D topography. Especially for turbid media with displaced, tilted or irregularly shaped surfaces, the reliable quantitative measurement of diffuse reflectance requires efficient calibration and correction methods. In this work, we present the implementation of a generic and hardware independent calibration routine for SFDI setups based on the so-called pinhole camera model for both projection and detection. Using a two-step geometric and intensity calibration, we obtain an imaging model that efficiently and accurately determines 3D topography and diffuse reflectance for subsequently measured samples, taking into account their relative distance and orientation to the camera and projector, as well as the distortions of the optical system. Derived correction procedures for position- and orientation-dependent changes in spatial frequency and intensity allow the determination of the effective scattering coefficient & mu;s & PRIME; and the absorption coefficient & mu;a when measuring a spherical optical phantom at three different measurement positions and at nine wavelengths with an average error of 5% and 12%, respectively. Model-based calibration allows the characterization of the imaging properties of the entire SFDI system without prior knowledge, enabling the future development of a digital twin for synthetic data generation or more robust evaluation methods.

AB  - 3-dimensional, accurate, and up-to-date maps are essential for vehicles with autonomous capabilities, whose functionality is made possible by machine learning-based algorithms. Since these solutions require a tremendous amount of data for parameter optimization, simulation-to-reality (Sim2Real) methods have been proven immensely useful for training data generation. For creating realistic models to be used for synthetic data generation, crowdsourcing techniques present a resource-efficient alternative. In this paper, we show that using the Carla simulation environment, a crowdsourcing model can be created that mimics a multi-agent data gathering and processing pipeline. We developed a solution that yields dense point clouds based on monocular images and location information gathered by individual data acquisition vehicles. Our method provides scene reconstructions using the robust Structure-from-Motion (SfM) solution of Colmap. Moreover, we introduce a solution for synthesizing dense ground truth point clouds originating from the Carla simulator using a simulated data acquisition pipeline. We compare the results of the Colmap reconstruction with the reference point cloud after aligning them using the iterative closest point algorithm. Our results show that a precise point cloud reconstruction was feasible with this crowdsourcing-based approach, with 54\% of the reconstructed points having an error under 0.05 m, and a weighted root mean square error of 0.0449 m for the entire point cloud.

AB  - Deep neural networks can be used to diagnose and detect plant diseases, helping to avoid the plant health-related crop production losses ranging from 20 to 50% annually. However, the data collection and annotation required to achieve high accuracies can be expensive and sometimes very difficult to obtain in specific use-cases. To this end, this work proposes a synthetic data generation pipeline based on generative adversarial networks (GANs), allowing users to artificially generate images to augment their small datasets through its web interface. The image-generation pipeline is tested on a home-collected dataset of whitefly pests, Bemisia tabaci, on different crop types. The data augmentation is shown to improve the performance of lightweight object detection models when the dataset size is increased from 140 to 560 images, seeing a jump in recall at 0.50 IoU from 54.4 to 93.2%, and an increase in the average IoU from 34.6 to 70.9%, without the use of GANs. When GANs are used to increase the number of source object masks and further diversify the dataset, there is an additional 1.4 and 2.6% increase in recall and average IoU, respectively. The authenticity of the generated data is also validated by human reviewers, who reviewed the GANs generated data and scored an average of 56% in distinguishing fake from real insects for low-resolutions sets, and 67% for high-resolution sets.

AB  - Ulcerative colitis (UC) belongs to the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) family, which is mainly caused by inflammation of the tissue in the colon and rectum. The severity of this infection can radically affect the patient's overall well-being. Although there is no definitive treatment for this disease, diagnosis of the severity of the disease through colonoscopy imaging and the use of personalized treatment can prevent progression to more malignant stages. Inter-and intra-observer variability combined with the complex nature of UC infection makes medical assessment cumbersome. Diagnosis and treatment of UC can be made more accurate and robust if disease severity can be determined in a standardized and automated manner. Therefore, the development of a computerized tool that can be integrated into the clinical decision-making process of UC classification is of great importance. In this work, we present an automated UC classification method, UC-NfNet, complemented by a synthetic data generation pipeline aimed at classifying colonoscopy UC images. We show that our model quantitatively outperforms state-of-the-art classification models such as ConViT, Inception-v4, NFNets, ResNets and Swin Transformer. In an independent reader study of five gastroenterologists, the average agreement between the UC-NfNet and individual gastroenterologists was higher than the agreement between individual gastroenterologists. This robust evaluation of the proposed AI system paves the way for clinical trials of AI -assisted UC classification. The code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/DeepMIALab/UC-NfNet.

AB  - Object detection and other machine learning technology applications play an important role in various areas of computer vision (CV) applications within the product lifecycle, especially in quality assurance or general assembly assistance. While the implemented CV-based systems provide great benefits, training and implementing deep learning models is often a tedious and time-consuming task, especially in the field of object detection. To accomplish good results, large datasets with a high quantity of object instances in a bright variety of poses are required These are generally created manually and are therefore very time consuming to create.
   To improve the training process, synthetic training data can be used. It is generated within a virtual environment using a product's geometry model. In this paper, the authors propose a synthetic dataset generator for object detection, that is integrated into a PLM system to automate the process of collecting and processing the CAD data for creating the synthetic machine learning training dataset. Domain randomization is used to eliminate the effort of creating a virtual environment, to fully automate the dataset generation, and to increase the generalization of the model. The trained detector is tested on an object detection demonstrator set-up to evaluate its performance in a real-world use case. For evaluation purposes, the authors also provide a comparison of the test results to an object detection model that is trained without domain randomization, using a very close-to-reality virtual environment.

AB  - Recommender systems (RSs) have become an integral part of the hiring process, be it via job advertisement ranking systems (job recommenders) for the potential employee or candidate ranking systems (candidate recommenders) for the employer. As seen in other domains, RSs are prone to harmful biases, unfair algorithmic behavior, and even discrimination in a legal sense. Some cases, such as salary equity in regards to gender (gender pay gap), stereotypical job perceptions along gendered lines, or biases toward other subgroups sharing specific characteristics in candidate recommenders, can have profound ethical and legal implications. In this survey, we discuss the current state of fairness research considering the fairness definitions (e.g., demographic parity and equal opportunity) used in recruitment-related RSs (RRSs). We investigate from a technical perspective the approaches to improve fairness, like synthetic data generation, adversarial training, protected subgroup distributional constraints, and post-hoc re-ranking. Thereafter, from a legal perspective, we contrast the fairness definitions and the effects of the aforementioned approaches with existing EU and US law requirements for employment and occupation, and second, we ascertain whether and to what extent EU and US law permits such approaches to improve fairness. We finally discuss the advances that RSs have made in terms of fairness in the recruitment domain, compare them with those made in other domains, and outline existing open challenges.

AB  - Segmentation of satellite images is the noteworthy and essential step for better understanding and analysis in various applications such as disaster and crisis management support, agriculture land detection, water body detection, identification of roads, buildings, transformation analysis of forested ecosystems, and translating satellite imagery to maps, where the satellite image can be utilized for remotely monitoring any specified region. This manuscript contemplates the comprehensive and comparative analysis of existing satellite image segmentation techniques with their advantages, disadvantages, experimental results, and futuristic discussion. The comprehensive and comparative analysis provides the basic platform and a new direction of research to perspective readers working in this area. In this review, existing segmentation techniques are extensively analyzed and categorized on the basis of their methodology similarities. In the reviewing process of state-of-the-art satellite image segmentation techniques, it has been noticed that the problems of semantic and instance segmentation are solved effectively using deep learning approaches. The entire review process exhibits the problem of the limited dataset, limited time to train a network, objects appearing differently from different imaging sensors, and class imbalance in semantic and instance segmentation. A fully convolutional network, U-Net, and its variants are utilized to solve these problems by applying transfer learning, synthetic data generation, artificially generated noisy data, and residual networks. This manuscript focuses on the existing work and helps to provide comparative results, challenges, and further improvement areas.

AB  - DDoS attacks pose a significant threat to institutions and companies that rely on interconnected networks for their operations. Differentiating between malicious attacks and legitimate increases in web traffic is challenging, and existing defense systems struggle to identify and mitigate such attacks accurately. This study explores the impact of data imbalance on the classification of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks and proposes a solution using synthetic data. The methodology involves data collection, preprocessing, synthetic data generation, and performance analysis. The CICDDoS2019 data set, containing over 20 million examples measured on 88 features, is used for evaluation. We generate synthetic data using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), focusing on three features of the original data set: time, attack type, and duration. The classification phase involved creating three distinct assemblies of the data. Varying the representation among the attack categories between balanced and imbalanced samples. We achieved this by handling the dataset: normally (imbalanced), sub-sampling to the minority class, and using GANs to generate an additional 2 million data points. A performance comparison between traditional classification methods (CNN, KNN, and XGBoost) and the use of GANs shows significant improvement. Traditional methods achieved 82-86% accuracy scores, while GANs achieved 98-99%. These findings highlight the impact of data imbalance on classification performance and demonstrate the effectiveness of GANs in mitigating the problem and enhancing accuracy. The study emphasizes the importance of considering data imbalance and innovative techniques like GANs in cybersecurity.

AB  - Two-dimensional electrophoresis gels (2DE, 2DEG) are the result of the procedure of separating, based on two molecular properties, a protein mixture on gel. Separated similar proteins concentrate in groups, and these groups appear as dark spots in the captured gel image. Gel images are analyzed to detect distinct spots and determine their peak intensity, background, integrated intensity, and other attributes of interest. One of the approaches to parameterizing the protein spots is spot modeling. Spot parameters of interest are obtained after the spot is approximated by a mathematical model. The development of the modeling algorithm requires a rich, diverse, representative dataset. The primary goal of this research is to develop a method for generating a synthetic protein spot dataset that can be used to develop 2DEG image analysis algorithms. The secondary objective is to evaluate the usefulness of the created dataset by developing a neural-network-based protein spot reconstruction algorithm that provides parameterization and denoising functionalities. In this research, a spot modeling algorithm based on autoencoders is developed using only the created synthetic dataset. The algorithm is evaluated on real and synthetic data. Evaluation results show that the created synthetic dataset is effective for the development of protein spot models. The developed algorithm outperformed all baseline algorithms in all experimental cases.

AB  - An electrochemical lithium-ion battery model is well known to be suited for effectively describing the microstructure evolution in charging and discharging processes of a lithium-ion battery with practically realizable complexity. This paper presents a neural network-based parameter estimation scheme to identify the parameters of an electrochemical lithium-ion battery model in a near-optimal and real-time manner in order to consistently observe the electrochemical states of batteries. The network is first trained to learn the dynamics of the electrochemical lithium-ion battery model, and then, it is applied to estimate the parameters with available finite-time measurements of voltage, current, temperature, and state of charge. In order to efficiently learn the dynamic characteristics of a lithium-ion battery, a well-known recurrent neural network, called a long short-term memory model, is employed with other techniques such as batch normalization, dropout, and stochastic gradient descent with warm restarts for learning speed enhancement and regularization. Using synthetic and experimental data, we show that the proposed estimation scheme works well, finding parameters and recovering the voltage profiles within the root-mean-square error of 0.43 & x0025; and 26 mV, respectively, even with measurements obtained within a sufficiently short interval of time.

AB  - Objective. Bloch simulation constitutes an essential part of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) development. However, even with the graphics processing unit (GPU) acceleration, the heavy computational load remains a major challenge, especially in large-scale, high-accuracy simulation scenarios. This work aims to develop a deep learning-based simulator to accelerate Bloch simulation. Approach. The simulator model, called Simu-Net, is based on an end-to-end convolutional neural network and is trained with synthetic data generated by traditional Bloch simulation. It uses dynamic convolution to fuse spatial and physical information with different dimensions and introduces position encoding templates to achieve position-specific labeling and overcome the receptive field limitation of the convolutional network. Main results. Compared with mainstream GPU-based MRI simulation software, Simu-Net successfully accelerates simulations by hundreds of times in both traditional and advanced MRI pulse sequences. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed framework were verified qualitatively and quantitatively. Besides, the trained Simu-Net was applied to generate sufficient customized training samples for deep learning-based T (2) mapping and comparable results to conventional methods were obtained in the human brain. Significance. As a proof-of-concept work, Simu-Net shows the potential to apply deep learning for rapidly approximating the forward physical process of MRI and may increase the efficiency of Bloch simulation for optimization of MRI pulse sequences and deep learning-based methods.

AB  - This paper presents a research work which focuses on generating synthetic data to enrich the training-set of a deep learning (DL) based classification system to classify power system transient events using PMU frequency measurements. The synthetically improved training-set is shown to increase the classification performance compared to the case when only the actual-data training-set is used. The proposed classification system helps to reveal high-frequency transient variation information out of PMU measurements collected at a relatively much lower rate, especially when a small set of training-data exists. Synthetic PMU frequency data is generated based on the DFT analysis statistics on the limited-size PMU frequency data. Generation of the synthetic data is achieved by re-synthesis of the PMU frequency data using inverse DFT, which imitates the DFT frequency and phase behaviour for each event type separately. Then the DL structure is trained to classify the power system transients using the synthetically enriched train set. The proposed method of generating synthetically supported training-set has lower computational complexity compared to the existing methods in the literature and helps to obtain improved classification results. It can be used to increase the classification performances of power quality devices performing transient event analysis, especially for those with access to a limited set of training-set.

AB  - Generative Language Models have shown promising results in various domains, and some of the most successful applications are related to "concept expansion", which is the task of generating extensive text based on concise instructions provided through a "seed" prompt. In this presentation we will discuss the recent work conducted by the Data Science team at SurveyMonkey, where we have recently introduced a new feature that harnesses Generative AI models to streamline the survey design process. With this feature users can effortlessly initiate this process by specifying their desired objectives through a prompt, allowing them to automate the creation of surveys that include the critical aspects they wish to investigate.
   We will share our findings regarding some of the challenges encountered during the development of this feature. These include techniques for conditioning the model outputs, integrating generated text with industry-standard questions, fine-tuning Language Models using semi-synthetic Data Generation techniques, and more. Moreover, we will showcase the Evaluation Methodology that we have developed to measure the quality of the generated surveys across several dimensions. This evaluation process is crucial in ensuring that the generated surveys align well with user expectations and serve their intended purpose effectively. Our goal is to demonstrate the promising potential of Generative Language Models in the context of Survey Research, and we believe that sharing our learnings on these challenges and how we addressed them will be useful for practitioners working with Language Models on similar problems.

AB  - Increased penetration of behind-the-meter (BTM) PV installations can cause numerous challenges in planning and operation of distribution systems. Utilities must accurately record the installed PVs in their territory and keep their PV database updated. However, many utilities do not have enough visibility on the actual installed PVs due the growing number of unauthorized PV installations as well as the complexity of data tracking and updating the databases even for authorized PVs. In this paper, a data-driven classification method is proposed for detecting BTM PV installation using convolutional neural networks and synthetic net load profiles generated from AMI data. The network is trained and tested on 50 folds of the dataset and the testing classification accuracy per each fold is calculated. Results show that the median of per-fold testing accuracies is 98.9% In terms of average error, only 0.7% of the customers with PV are not detected. This is significantly less than the 6% error in the next best method. The impact of training data parameters, such as the size of dataset and label errors on the accuracy and computational time of the method is also studied and characterized. Using only the available AMI data, the proposed method can help utilities accurately monitor BTM PV systems and keep their databases updated and thus avoid the costs of operation and planning errors.

AB  - The proposed research study investigates the relationship between Bone Mineral Density (BMD) values extracted from computed tomography (CT) scans, with a primary focus on their significance in vertebral segmentation. The study includes 25 subjects spanning five age groups; the study reveals a continuous reduction in mean Hounsfield Unit (HU) values with aging, validated by statistical analysis that emphasizes the importance of these findings across different vertebral levels. The data exposes a steady decline in mean BMD values with age, ranging from 175.05 HU in the 40s to 51.8 HU in the over-80s age group, exhibiting statistically significant differences ( p < 0.05 ). Subgroup analysis provides granular insights into age-related variations at specific lumbar vertebrae levels by contributing valuable information to the complexities of bone health assessment. The research connects mathematics and medical imaging to improve our understanding of vertebral characteristics by introducing the Radon Transform as a fundamental tool in CT image reconstruction. These findings include both p and mean values which have the potential to revolutionize the field of bone health assessment by affecting public health policy and opening the way for more personalized and successful treatment options. This includes the earlier detection of conditions like osteoporosis and improvements in patient care.

AB  - Learning-based approaches have shown promising results in several medical imaging applications. However, the performance of the models is affected by the scarcity of the available data. This problem is partially circumvented by using simulation tools to create a large dataset. However, the generation of realistic 3D-simulated input-output pairs, specifically in ultrasound imaging, is usually computationally complex which makes the creation of an adequate training dataset a burdening and time-consuming task. In this work, we investigate the capability of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate two interrelated RF signals from random noise while learning the relationship between them. This allows us to incorporate the generated input-output signal-pairs in the training dataset to enhance the performance of a deep learning-based ultrasound application, specifically harmonic imaging. Convolutional based generator and discriminator networks are implemented with three different loss functions to evaluate the performance of the model across different settings. The generated signals are then used to augment the training dataset for harmonic imaging. The dataset augmented with the generated synthetic data enhanced the desired signals estimation by 6.7% compared to the non-augmented dataset. These results demonstrate the GANs ability to generate high quality and diverse ultrasound signal-pairs with a close distribution to the simulated data, yet at a considerably higher speed. This approach could be further extended to enhance the prediction accuracy in other ultrasound applications.

AB  - Agriculture's pivotal role in sustaining livelihoods and driving economic growth is widely recognized, yet various challenges like the adverse effects of climate change and limited resource availability hinder its productivity. Notably, plants are susceptible to various viruses and bacteria, impacting yield and food security. The emergence of deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), has transformed agriculture by facilitating tasks such as disease detection. However, a significant challenge arises from the often unrealistic assumption that training and testing data share the same distribution. To address this, domain adaptation and transfer learning techniques have been employed, bridging the gap between different data distributions. Therefore, a novel framework named 'Zero-Shot Transfer Learning' is introduced. This addresses the challenge of improving classifier performance when trained on a source domain with different classes and tested on a target domain, exemplified by tomato and potato datasets. More specifically, in this framework, we include different CNN models along with techniques such as data augmentation, synthetic data generation, and robust discriminative losses, enhancing classifier performance in zero-shot scenarios. Extensive experiments on plant leaf disease classification under the zero-shot Transfer Learning assumption demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework for effective disease classification. Ultimately, this framework holds the potential to promote crop yield optimization and ensure food security.

AB  - Dominance based rough set approach is important in studies conducted with datasets con-taining uncertainty. In this study, a dataset consisting of 1030 samples obtained in the labora-tory regarding compressive strength of concrete has been considered. The decision attribute, which has continuous values, has been made discrete for applying dominance relation. In order to measure performance, samples in the dataset have been divided into two groups: the training set and the testing set. This process has been done in a way that corresponds to the distribution of each class within the dataset. On the other hand, since there is a class which has more or less samples than the others, synthetic data generation has been done with Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) in order to handle the between-class imbalance problem and equalize the number of samples in the classes. As a result, the training set has been made perfectly balanced. A decision-support model which extracts "if... then..." exact decision rules has been designed to be used in determining the quality or compressive strength of the concrete samples by using dominance based rough set approach. Performance of these rules on the testing set through the confusion matrix has been discussed. The exper-imental results show that performance of the exact decision rules induced by the dominance rough set approach on the testing set is significant.

AB  - Use of synthetic data has provided a potential solution for addressing unavailable or insufficient training samples in deep learning-based magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, the challenge brought by domain gap between synthetic and real data is usually encountered, especially under complex experimental conditions. In this study, by combining Bloch simulation and general MRI models, we propose a framework for addressing the lack of training data in supervised learning scenarios, termed MOST-DL. A challenging application is demonstrated to verify the proposed framework and achieve motion-robust T-2 mapping using single-shot overlapping-echo acquisition. We decompose the process into two main steps: (1) calibrationless parallel reconstruction for ultra-fast pulse sequence and (2) intra-shot motion correction for T-2 mapping. To bridge the domain gap, realistic textures from a public database and various imperfection simulations were explored. The neural network was first trained with pure synthetic data and then evaluated with in vivo human brain. Both simulation and in vivo experiments show that the MOST-DL method significantly reduces ghosting and motion artifacts in T-2 maps in the presence of unpredictable subject movement and has the potential to be applied to motion-prone patients in the clinic. Our code is available at https://github.com/qinginyang/MOST-DL.

AB  - Modern power sector requires grid observability under all scenarios for its ideal functioning. This enforces the operator to incorporate state estimation solutions based on a priori measurements to deduce the corresponding operating states of the grid. The key principle for such aforementioned algorithms lies on an occurrence of an over determined class of system having an ample redundancy in the measurements. Operators employ state forecasting solutions to counter the loss of real-time measurements. This work encompasses a critical comparison between several machine learning models along with ARIMA and time delayed neural network architecture for proper forecasting of operating states under normal as well as contingency scenarios. To showcase the efficacy of the proposed approach, this work incorporates a comprehensive comparison between them based on RMSE, MSE and MAE index. Copula-based synthetic data generation based on Gaussian multivariate distribution of the a priori measurements and operating states along with optimal hyper-parameter tuning of the models have shown the effectiveness of such algorithms in predicting future state estimates. The proposed machine learning models can be also seen to showcase an effective forecasting strategy under varying noise scenarios. This work also showcases the implementation of the models for real-time state forecasting strategy having computational times in the order of micro seconds. All the simulations have been carried out on the standard IEEE 14 bus test bench to support the former proposals.

TI  - SafeSea: Synthetic Data Generation for Adverse & Low Probability Maritime Conditions

AB  - High-quality training data is essential for enhancing the robustness of object detection models. Within the maritime domain, obtaining a diverse real image dataset is particularly challenging due to the difficulty of capturing sea images with the presence of maritime objects, especially in stormy conditions. These challenges arise due to resource limitations, in addition to the unpredictable appearance of maritime objects. Nevertheless, acquiring data from stormy conditions is essential for training effective maritime detection models, particularly for search and rescue, where real-world conditions can be unpredictable. In this work, we introduce SafeSea, which is a stepping stone towards transforming actual sea images with various Sea State backgrounds while retaining maritime objects. Compared to existing generative methods such as Stable Diffusion Inpainting [27], this approach reduces the time and effort required to create synthetic datasets for training maritime object detection models. The proposed method uses two automated filters to only pass generated images that meet the criteria. In particular, these filters will first classify the sea condition according to its Sea State level and then it will check whether the objects from the input image are still preserved. This method enabled the creation of the SafeSea dataset, offering diverse weather condition backgrounds to supplement the training of maritime models. Lastly, we observed that a maritime object detection model faced challenges in detecting objects in stormy sea backgrounds, emphasizing the impact of weather conditions on detection accuracy. The code, and dataset are available at https://github.com/martin-3240/SafeSea.

AB  - Referring expression comprehension (REC) system solves a task to localize objects in a given image, based on natural language expression. We propose a novel approach to adapting the pre-trained REC model for the manufacturing domain. Despite significant advances in REC research, current REC datasets fail to recognize objects from specific yet important domains such as manufacturing due to the absence of domain-specific samples during training. Thus, we introduce a synthetic data-based domain adaptation approach for REC. To adapt a REC model to the manufacturing domain, we generated a synthetic REC dataset RefMD that consists of two sub-datasets: (1) dataset for manufacturing object classification, and (2) dataset for REC adaptation to manufacturing. Each dataset serves as one step toward the REC adaptation. Adaptation of the object classification network (visual backbone) is carried out by training ResNet50 on domain-specific labeled data, while the REC adaptation completes with the adaptation of modules in RealGIN altogether. The manufacturing domain-adapted model is further enhanced with the capability to handle ambiguous referring expressions through human-in-the-loop (HITL) interaction. The experiments on 3D-printed manufacturing objects demonstrate that the interactive REC model can accurately comprehend human instructions with an 82% accuracy. This paper introduces an approach to facilitate domain adaptation using solely synthetic data for the specific case of the manufacturing domain. However, the proposed adaptation methodology can be applied to any other domain by following the same synthetic data generation process.

AB  - The accurate prediction of global horizontal irradiance (GHI) is crucial for optimizing solar power generation systems, particularly in mountainous areas with complex topography and unique microclimates. These regions face significant challenges due to limited reliable data and the dynamic nature of local weather conditions, which complicate accurate GHI measurement. The scarcity of precise data impedes the development of reliable solar energy prediction models, impacting both economic and environmental outcomes. To address these data scarcity challenges in solar energy prediction, this paper focuses on various locations in Europe and Asia Minor, predominantly in mountainous regions. Advanced machine learning techniques, including random forest (RF) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) regressors, are employed to effectively predict GHI. Additionally, optimizing training data distribution based on cloud opacity values and integrating synthetic data significantly enhance predictive accuracy, with R2 scores ranging from 0.91 to 0.97 across multiple locations. Furthermore, substantial reductions in root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean bias error (MBE) underscore the improved reliability of the predictions. Future research should refine synthetic data generation, optimize additional meteorological and environmental parameter integration, extend methodology to new regions, and test for predicting global tilted irradiance (GTI). The studies should expand training data considerations beyond cloud opacity, incorporating sky cover and sunshine duration to enhance prediction accuracy and reliability.

AB  - Quantifying the number of occupants in an indoor space is useful for a wide variety of applications. Attempts have been made at solving the task using passive infrared (PIR) motion sensor data together with supervised learning methods. Collecting a large labeled dataset containing both PIR motion sensor data and ground truth people count is however time-consuming, often requiring one hour of observation for each hour of data gathered. In this paper, a method is proposed for generating such data synthetically. A simulator is developed in the Unity game engine capable of producing synthetic PIR motion sensor data by detecting simulated occupants. The accuracy of the simulator is tested by replicating a real-world meeting room inside the simulator and conducting an experiment where a set of choreographed movements are performed in the simulated environment as well as the real room. In 34 out of 50 tested situations, the output from the simulated PIR sensors is comparable to the output from the real-world PIR sensors. The developed simulator is also used to study how a PIR sensor's output changes depending on where in a room a motion is carried out. Through this, the relationship between sensor output and spatial position of a motion is discovered to be highly non-linear, which highlights some of the difficulties associated with mapping PIR data to occupancy count.

AB  - The usage of both off-the-shelf and end-to-end trained deep networks have significantly improved the performance of visual tracking on RGB videos. However, the lack of large labeled datasets hampers the usage of convolutional neural networks for tracking in thermal infrared (TIR) images. Therefore, most state-of-the-art methods on tracking for TIR data are still based on handcrafted features. To address this problem, we propose to use image-to-image translation models. These models allow us to translate the abundantly available labeled RGB data to synthetic TIR data. We explore both the usage of paired and unpaired image translation models for this purpose. These methods provide us with a large labeled dataset of synthetic TIR sequences, on which we can train end-to-end optimal features for tracking. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to train end-to-end features for TIR tracking. We perform extensive experiments on the VOT-TIR2017 dataset. We show that a network trained on a large dataset of synthetic TIR data obtains better performance than one trained on the available real TIR data. Combining both data sources leads to further improvement. In addition, when we combine the network with motion features, we outperform the state of the art with a relative gain of over 10%, clearly showing the efficiency of using synthetic data to train end-to-end TIR trackers.

AB  - Production increase in agriculture depends on some parameters such as improving arable land, activating spraying and irrigation activities. In ad-dition to these, it is known that spraying and seed types have an effect on productivity. Therefore, proper selection of seed types is important. With the developing technology, big data consisting of scientific studies can be recorded digitally and used in the estimation or decision-making process. In this study, chickpea species diversity was made with classification process using machine learning methods by taking advantage of the characteristics of chickpea plant. In addition, productivity per decare was estimated by regression process. Ac-curacy was preferred as a success criterion for classification, and rmse success criterion was preferred for regression. The dataset was first used raw, and then experiments were made using synthetic data. To generate synthetic data, the synthetic minority oversampling technique method and also the n-shifting mean method proposed in this study were used. When the success rates of the results obtained were compared, the highest success rate was 90.6% in the classification made using only raw data. Likewise, the classification success rate of the dataset using the synthetic data created with the raw data was the highest 100%. For regression, the highest score was 0.17 for raw data and 0.16 for synthetic data. The high performance of the results showed that machine learning algorithms can be used in this field.

AB  - Software aging refers to a problem of performance decay in the software systems, which are running for a long period. The primary cause of this phenomenon is the accumulation of run-time errors in the software, which are also known as aging-related bugs (ARBs). Many efforts have been reported earlier to predict the origin of ARBs in the software so that these bugs can be identified and fixed during testing. Imbalanced dataset, where the representation of ARBs patterns is very less as compared to the representation of the non-ARBs pattern significantly hinders the performance of the ARBs prediction models. Therefore, in this article, we present an oversampling approach, generative adversarial networks-based synthetic data generation-based ARBs prediction models. The approach uses generative adversarial networks to generate synthetic samples for the ARBs patterns in the given datasets implicitly and build the prediction models on the processed datasets. To validate the performance of the presented approach, we perform an experimental study for the seven ARBs datasets collected from the public repository and use various performance measures to evaluate the results. The experimental results showed that the presented approach led to the improved performance of prediction models for the ARBs prediction as compared to the other state-of-the-art models.

AB  - Nowadays, data created through the usage of different services are most commonly not available to the average researcher. Security and privacy have become a top concern, which has further restricted access to certain real-life data, especially holding true for social networks. This is why synthetic data generators have become a very important area of research, particularly synthetic social graph generators. However, even today, such generators mostly create graphs that contain just the information whether two nodes are connected. Fortunately, there is an existing conceptual solution for an expanded social graph generator that aims to generate synthetic graphs containing multiple weighted edges between nodes, thus showing various types of relationships among those nodes, all based on known real-life data characteristics. One of its proposed steps is the generation of necessary data according to provided distributions and correlations. This paper focuses on the generation of such data by adapting an existing iterative algorithm for non-normal multivariate data simulation to generate synthetic data based on the publicly available distributions and correlations of Facebook interaction parameters. It is shown that the characteristics of the generated synthetic data are similar to the known characteristics of the real-life data, proving that the chosen algorithm, along with the accompanying alterations, can be used as one of the steps within the process of generating a synthetic expanded social graph.

AB  - The identification of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) relies on laborious and expensive polysomnography (PSG) exams. However, it is known that other factors, easier to measure, can be good indicators of OSA and its severity. In this work, we extensively investigate the use of Machine Learning techniques in the task of determining which factors are more revealing with respect to OSA. We ran extensive experiments over 1,042 patients from the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire of the city of Grenoble, France. The data included ordinary clinical information, and PSG results as a baseline. We employed data preparation techniques including cleaning of outliers, imputation of missing values, and synthetic data generation. Following, we performed an exhaustive attribute selection scheme to find the most representative features. We found that the prediction of OSA depends largely on variables related to age, body mass, and sleep habits more than the ones related to alcoholism, smoking, and depression. Next, we tested 60 regression/classification algorithms to predict the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI), and the AHI-based severity of OSA. We achieved performances significantly superior to the state of the art both for AHI regression and classification. Our results can benefit the development of tools for the automatic screening of patients who should go through polysomnography and further treatments of OSA. Our methodology enables experimental reproducibility on similar OSA-detection problems, and more generally, on other problems with similar data models.

AB  - There has been considerable research on modelling various aspects of drought such as identification and prediction of its duration and severity. The term severity has various connotations in drought literature such as in hydrological drought, where it is defined as the Cumulative shortage or the deficit sum with reference to a pre-specified truncation level. In meteorological drought, the severity has rather been defined in the form of indices such as the Palmer drought severity index. There exist a variety of techniques and methods to analyse the duration and severity of meteorological and hydrological droughts through probability characterization of low flows, time series methods, synthetic data generation, theory of runs, multiple regression, group theory, pattern recognition and neural network methods. Agricultural droughts arc analysed based on soil moisture modelling concepts with crop yield considerations and using multiple linear regression techniques. The prediction aspects of drought duration are developed better than the drought severity aspects, These latter need to be improved because information on drought severity is of paramount practical importance and forms an essential part of the design process of storage facilities for abatement of droughts. A major challenge of drought research is to develop suitable methods and techniques for forecasting the onset and termination points of droughts. An equally challenging task is the dissemination of drought research results for practical usage and wider applications.

AB  - As energy system design moves to more complex methods of optimisation including machine learning there is a significant need for more weather data than is available. One method to solve this is using synthetic data models such as the auto -regressive moving -average (ARMA) model which has been frequently utilised to create such data. This paper looks at extending the ARMA algorithm to generate solar components through the use of clearsky detrending, maintaining vector relationships and by leveraging physical relationships. The method for the creation of entirely synthetic weather data files including key weather variables for energy system analysis is presented. Furthermore, a detailed comparison of energy system simulations utilising both real and synthetic data is made using NREL's System Advisor Model. Whilst good agreement is made for the solar variables, and other weather variables, ARMA methods often fail to capture the standard deviation and skew of annual weather distributions. Vector-ARMA is shown to maintain correlations between variables and thus generate data sets that perform similarly in energy system design. It is finally shown that the ARMA method fails to preserve day -today correlations in weather variables and thus over -predicts optimal energy storage by 21% for a residential solar application.

AB  - As cars evolve to be smarter than ever, they also become susceptible to attack. Malicious entities can attempt to override automated functions by sending a series of attack signals to the smart vehicle. It is thus imperative that we create systems to detect these attacks on the fly, so that they may be discarded. Machine learning approaches are a natural choice for detecting such attacks based on the payload information. However, machine learning models typically require a large dataset for training, in order to attain good performance. With manufacturers independently gathering this data based on their own cars, it is unlikely that all this data will be available in one place. To address this issue, we explore federated solutions that learn in a distributed manner for increased smart vehicle security. We explore challenging scenarios in which we do not assume an independent and identically distributed (IID) setting for the data, which is typical in many federated learning environments. We investigate various degrees of such heterogeneity in the attack data distribution between different manufacturers, and study the effectiveness of detection systems under them. Furthermore, with a combination of techniques including triplet-mixup based augmentation and a data exchange scheme involving synthetically generated samples, we show that we can attain strong performance in the most challenging label distribution scenarios. We perform our experiments on a publicly available dataset and on a proprietary attack dataset developed for this project.

AB  - In this digital world, numerous credit card-based transactions take place all over the world. Concomitantly, gaps in process flows and technology result in many fraudulent transactions. Owing to the spurt in the number of reported fraudulent transactions, customers and credit card service providers incur significant financial and reputation losses respectively. Therefore, building a powerful fraud detection system is paramount. It is noteworthy that fraud detection datasets, by nature, are highly unbalanced. Consequently, almost all of the supervised classifiers, when built on the unbalanced datasets, yield high false negative rates. But, the extant oversampling methods while reducing the false negatives, increase the false positives. In this paper, we propose a novel data oversampling method using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). We use GAN and its variant to generate synthetic data of fraudulent transactions. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we employ machine learning classifiers on the data balanced by GAN. Our proposed GAN-based oversampling method simultaneously achieved high precision, F1-score and dramatic reduction in the count of false positives compared to the state-of-the-art synthetic data generation based oversampling methods such as Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), Adaptive Synthetic Sampling (ADASYN) and random oversampling. Moreover, an ablation study involving the oversampling based on the ensemble of SMOTE and GAN/WGAN generated datasets indicated that it is outperformed by the proposed methods in terms of F1 score and false positive count.

AB  - The vision of a deep learning-empowered non-destructive evaluation technique aligns perfectly with the goal of zero-defect manufacturing, enabling manufacturers to detect and repair defects actively. However, the dearth of data in manufacturing is one of the biggest obstacles to realizing an intelligent defect detection system. This work presents a framework for bridging the data gap in manufacturing using the potential of synthetic datasets generated using the finite element method-based digital twin. The non-destructive technique under consideration is pulse infrared thermography. A large number of synthetic thermographic measurements were generated using 2D axisymmetric transient thermal simulations. The representativeness of synthetic data was thoroughly investigated at various steps of the framework, and the image segmentation model was trained separately on experimental and synthetic datasets. The study results reveal that when carefully rendered, synthetic datasets represent the experimental data well. When evaluated on real-world experimental samples, the segmentation model pre-trained on synthetic datasets generalizes well to the experimental samples. Furthermore, another advantage of synthetic datasets is the ease of labelling a large amount of data. Finally, the robustness assessment of the model was done on two new datasets: one where the complete experimental setup was changed, and the other was an open-source infrared thermography dataset

AB  - Advances in remote sensing image processing techniques have further increased the demand for annotated datasets. However, preparing annotated multi-temporal 2D/3D multimodal data is especially challenging, both for the increased costs of the annotation step and the lack of multimodal acquisitions available on the same area. We introduce the Simulated Multimodal Aerial Remote Sensing (SMARS) dataset, a synthetic dataset aimed at the tasks of urban semantic segmentation, change detection, and building extraction, along with a description of the pipeline to generate them and the parameters required to set our rendering. Samples in the form of orthorectified photos, digital surface models and ground truth for all the tasks are provided. Unlike existing datasets, orthorectified images and digital surface models are derived from synthetic images using photogrammetry, yielding more realistic simulations of the data. The increased size of SMARS, compared to available datasets of this kind, facilitates both traditional and deep learning algorithms. Reported experiments from state-of-the-art algorithms on SMARS scenes yield satisfactory results, in line with our expectations. Both benefits of the SMARS datasets and constraints imposed by its use are discussed. Specifically, building detection on the SMARS-real Potsdam cross-domain test demonstrates the quality and the advantages of proposed synthetic data generation workflow. SMARS is published as an ISPRS benchmark dataset and can be downloaded from https://www2.isprs.org/commissions/comm1/wg8/benchmark_smars/.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based models can help in diagnosing COVID-19 from lung CT scans and X-ray images; however, these models require large amounts of data for training and validation. Many researchers studied Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for producing synthetic lung CT scans and X-Ray images to improve the performance of AI-based models. It is not well explored how good GAN-based methods performed to generate reliable synthetic data. This work analyzes 43 published studies that reported GANs for synthetic data generation. Many of these studies suffered data bias, lack of reproducibility, and lack of feedback from the radiologists or other domain experts. A common issue in these studies is the unavailability of the source code, hindering reproducibility. The included studies reported rescaling of the input images to train the existing GANs architecture without providing clinical insights on how the rescaling was motivated. Finally, even though GAN-based methods have the potential for data augmentation and improving the training of AI-based models, these methods fall short in terms of their use in clinical practice. This paper highlights research hotspots in countering the data scarcity problem, identifies various issues as well as potentials, and provides recommendations to guide future research. These recommendations might be useful to improve acceptability for the GAN-based approaches for data augmentation as GANs for data augmentation are increasingly becoming popular in the AI and medical imaging research community.

AB  - Images captured by mobile camera systems are subject to distortions that can be irreversible. Sources of these distortions vary and can be attributed to sensor imperfections, lens defects, or shutter inefficiency. One form of image distortion is associated with high Parasitic-Light-Sensitivity (PLS) in CMOS Image Sensors when combined with Global Shutters (GS-CIS) in a moving camera system. The resulting distortion appears as widespread semi-transparent purple artifacts, or a complex purple fringe, covering a large area in the scene around high-intensity regions. Most of the earlier approaches addressing the purple fringing problems have been directed towards the simplest forms of this distortion and rely on heuristic image processing algorithms. Recently, machine learning methods have shown remarkable success in many image restoration and object detection problems. Nevertheless, they have not been applied for the complex purple fringing detection or correction. In this paper, we present our exploration and deployment of deep learning algorithms in a pipeline for the detection and correction of the purple fringing induced by high-PLS GS-CIS sensors. Experiments show that the proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art approaches for both problems of detection and color restoration. We achieve a final MS-SSIM of 0.966 on synthetic data, and a distortion classification accuracy of 96.97%. We further discuss the limitations and possible improvements over the proposed methods.

AB  - Probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE) is a recent imaging modality that allows performing in vivo optical biopsies. The design of pCLE hardware, and its reliance on an optical fibre bundle, fundamentally limits the image quality with a few tens of thousands fibres, each acting as the equivalent of a single-pixel detector, assembled into a single fibre bundle. Video registration techniques can be used to estimate high-resolution (HR) images by exploiting the temporal information contained in a sequence of low-resolution (LR) images. However, the alignment of LR frames, required for the fusion, is computationally demanding and prone to artefacts.
   In this work, we propose a novel synthetic data generation approach to train exemplar-based Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). HR pCLE images with enhanced quality are recovered by the models trained on pairs of estimated HR images (generated by the video registration algorithm) and realistic synthetic LR images. Performance of three different state-of-the-art DNNs techniques were analysed on a Smart Atlas database of 8806 images from 238 pCLE video sequences. The results were validated through an extensive image quality assessment that takes into account different quality scores, including a Mean Opinion Score (MOS).
   Results indicate that the proposed solution produces an effective improvement in the quality of the obtained reconstructed image.
   The proposed training strategy and associated DNNs allows us to perform convincing super-resolution of pCLE images.

AB  - PurposeSynthetic realistic-looking bronchoscopic videos are needed to develop and evaluate depth estimation methods as part of investigating vision-based bronchoscopic navigation system. To generate these synthetic videos under the circumstance where access to real bronchoscopic images/image sequences is limited, we need to create various realistic-looking image textures of the airway inner surface with large size using a small number of real bronchoscopic image texture patches.MethodsA generative adversarial networks-based method is applied to create realistic-looking textures of the airway inner surface by learning from a limited number of small texture patches from real bronchoscopic images. By applying a purely convolutional architecture without any fully connected layers, this method allows the production of textures with arbitrary size.ResultsAuthentic image textures of airway inner surface are created. An example of the synthesized textures and two frames of the thereby generated bronchoscopic video are shown. The necessity and sufficiency of the generated textures as image features for further depth estimation methods are demonstrated.ConclusionsThe method can generate textures of the airway inner surface that meet the requirements for the texture itself and for the thereby generated bronchoscopic videos, including "realistic-looking," "long-term temporal consistency," "sufficient image features for depth estimation," and "large size and variety of synthesized textures." Besides, it also shows advantages with respect to the easy accessibility to required data source. A further validation of this approach is planned by utilizing the realistic-looking bronchoscopic videos with textures generated by this method as training and test data for some depth estimation networks.

AB  - Medical data is shared with a wide range for various research purposes and an extensive amount of research has been developed in the data privacy community for anonymization. Unfortunately, Data anonymization techniques do not provide data privacy guarantees and synthetic data generation is an alternative approach in data anonymization. Deep learning has recently achieved more reputation for its high accuracy and privacy concern. Nowadays, deep learning is extensively applied in the medical field for classification, segmentation and privacy-preserving. Using Deep learning, synthetic data can be generated to improve the privacy of the original medical data and also to prevent attacks. Deep learning models capture the relationship between multiple features in medical data. In this research, Healthcare Cramer Generative Adversarial Network (HCGAN) is proposed, where (i) the Quasi Identifiers (QI) are identified in medical data and separated as QI attributes and the remaining attributes are considered as Sensitive Attributes (SA) (ii) f-differential privacy anonymization technique is applied only to the identified QI and the final result is combined with the SA attribute (iii) The anonymized medical data is used as real data for training Cramer Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) where Cramer distance is used to improve the efficiency of the model. (iv) Finally, Privacy is checked by overcoming the attacks. The result shows that the HCGAN method effectively prevents attacks during the training and testing phase compared to Wasserstein GAN. The result demonstrates that health care GAN generates synthetic data that can provide high privacy and overcome various attacks.

AB  - One of the limiting factors in training data-driven, rare-event prediction algorithms is the scarcity of the events of interest resulting in an extreme imbalance in the data. There have been many methods introduced in the literature for overcoming this issue; simple data manipulation through undersampling and oversampling, utilizing cost-sensitive learning algorithms, or by generating synthetic data points following the distribution of the existing data. While synthetic data generation has recently received a great deal of attention, there are real challenges involved in doing so for high-dimensional data such as multivariate time series. In this study, we explore the usefulness of the conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) as a means to perform data-informed oversampling in order to balance a large dataset of multivariate time series. We utilize a flare forecasting benchmark dataset, named SWANSF, and design two verification methods to both quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the similarity between the generated minority and the ground-truth samples. We further assess the quality of the generated samples by training a classical, supervised machine learning algorithm on synthetic data, and testing the trained model on the unseen, real data. The results show that the classifier trained on the data augmented with the synthetic multivariate time series achieves a significant improvement compared with the case where no augmentation is used. The popular flare forecasting evaluation metrics, TSS and HSS, report 20-fold and 5-fold improvements, respectively, indicating the remarkable statistical similarities, and the usefulness of CGAN-based data generation for complicated tasks such as flare forecasting.

AB  - Seismic fault segmentation plays a crucial role in geophysics, especially in the exploration and extraction of oil and natural gas. However, identifying faults from seismic data is challenging and time-consuming due to the large volumes of data, complexity, noise, ambiguity, and reliance on subjective manual identification by specialists. To address these challenges, various automated methods based on Deep Learning have been proposed, but they require substantial amounts of labeled data. Synthetic data generation has been explored as a solution to generalize models for new real data, but it faces the domain shift problem, where different datasets may have different distributions and behaviour. In this paper, we propose a novel approach using Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) techniques to mitigate the domain shift issue in seismic fault detection. We utilize a synthetic dataset known for its use in the FaultSeg3D model and a labeled real dataset called Thebe. The selected techniques include Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and Fourier Domain Adaptation (FDA). MMD aims to reduce the discrepancy between internal layer outputs in the neural network (feature-level), while FDA transfers features between input images (image-level). For the experiments, we employed a smaller version of UNet and a variant called Atrous UNet, which has shown improvements in seismic images by utilizing Dilated Convolutional layers. The results demonstrated up to a 12% improvement in Intersection over Union and a 10% improvement in F1 by applying UDA techniques. Moreover, the proposed approach achieved more continuous and fewer false positive seismic fault detections.

AB  - Synthetic data generation has become essential in last years for feeding data-driven algorithms, which surpassed traditional techniques performance in almost every computer vision problem. Gathering and labelling the amount of data needed for these data-hungry models in the real world may become unfeasible and error-prone, while synthetic data give us the possibility of generating huge amounts of data with pixel-perfect annotations. However, most synthetic datasets lack from enough realism in their rendered images. In that context UnrealROX generation tool was presented in 2019, allowing to generate highly realistic data, at high resolutions and framerates, with an efficient pipeline based on Unreal Engine, a cutting-edge videogame engine. UnrealROX enabled robotic vision researchers to generate realistic and visually plausible data with full ground truth for a wide variety of problems such as class and instance semantic segmentation, object detection, depth estimation, visual grasping, and navigation. Nevertheless, its workflow was very tied to generate image sequences from a robotic on-board camera, making hard to generate data for other purposes. In this work, we present UnrealROX+, an improved version of UnrealROX where its decoupled and easy-to-use data acquisition system allows to quickly design and generate data in a much more flexible and customizable way. Moreover, it is packaged as an Unreal plug-in, which makes it more comfortable to use with already existing Unreal projects, and it also includes new features such as generating albedo or a Python API for interacting with the virtual environment from Deep Learning frameworks.

AB  - The TPC benchmarks have helped users evaluate database system performance at different scales. Although each benchmark is domain-specific, it is not equally relevant to different applications in the same domain. The present proliferation of applications also leaves many of them uncovered by the very limited number of current TPC benchmarks.
   There is therefore a need to develop tools for application-specific database benchmarking. This paper presents UpSizeR, a software that addresses the Dataset Scaling Problem: Given an empirical set of relational tables D and a scale factor s, generate a database state (D) over tilde, that is similar to D but s times its size. Such a tool can be useful for scaling up 7, for scalability testing (s > 1), scaling down for application testing (s < 1), or anonymization (s = 1).
   Experiments with Flickr show that query results and response times on UpSizeR output match those on crawled data. They also accurately predict throughput degradation for a scale out test.
   The UpSizeR version in this paper focuses on extracting and replicating the correlation induced by the primary and foreign keys. There are many other forms of correlation involving non-key values. It is a large task to develop UpSizeR into a tool that can extract and replicate all important correlation, so community effort is required. The current UpSizeR code has therefore been released for open-source development. The ultimate objective is to replace TPC with UpSizeR, so database owners can generate benchmarks that are relevant to their applications. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Augmented reality tracking is the core problem of augmented reality, which has not been well resolved so far, and limits the wider application of industrial augmented reality in actual industrial scenarios to a certain extent. In this paper, we propose a general pose estimation, refinement, and tracking framework for industrial augmented reality system. First, we propose a deep convolutional neural network for texture-less object pose estimation at first look. And a synthetic data generation pipeline is utilized to synthesize photorealistic training images for the network. Then, we implement the metric initialization of a monocular visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) through object pose, and the real-time camera pose is continuously tracked by the monocular visual SLAM. During the tracking process, a back-end pose optimization thread is proposed to calculate the pose residual between the model and real scene, and correct the pose residual in real time. Finally, the entire assembly models are superimposed on the real scene through transformation relationships included in the CAD models. The experiments on a gearbox assembly scenario show that the proposed method gives a highest tracking accuracy in compared with a marker-based methods and two state-of-the-art CNN-based object pose estimation methods. The whole proposed pipeline runs at 25 FPS for real-time tracking. Moreover, the proposed method is also applied to a shipbuilding outfitting construction scenario, and shows good scalability and generality for the complex and large-scale industrial scenario and different mobile terminals.

KW  - Data generation
KW  - Evaluation
AB  - Research on cross-domain recommendation systems (CDRS) has shown efficiency by leveraging the overlapping associations between domains in order to generate more encompassing user models and better recommendations. Nonetheless, if there is no dataset belonging to a specific domain, it is a challenge to generate recommendations in CDRS. In addition, finding these overlapping associations in the real world is generally tricky, and it makes its application to actual services hard. Considering these issues, this study aims to present a synthetic data generation platform (called DaGzang) for cross-domain recommendation systems. The DaGzang platform works according to the complete loop, and it consists of the following three steps: (i) detecting the overlap association (data distribution pattern) between the real-world datasets, (ii) generating synthetic datasets based on these overlap associations, and (iii) evaluating the quality of the generated synthetic datasets. The real-world datasets in our experiments were collected from Amazon's e-commercial website. To validate the usefulness of the synthetic datasets generated from DaGzang, we embed these datasets into our cross-domain recommender system, called DakGalBi. We then evaluate the recommendations generated from DakGalBi with collaborative filtering (CF) algorithms, user-based CF, and item-based CF. Mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) metrics are measured to evaluate the performance of collaborative filtering (CF) CDRS. In particular, the highest performance of the three recommendation methods is user-based CF when using 10 synthetic datasets generated from DaGzang (0.437 at MAE and 0.465 at RMSE).

AB  - Traditionally, in supervised machine learning, (a significant) part of the available data (usually 50%-80%) is used for training and the rest-for validation. In many problems, however, the data are highly imbalanced in regard to different classes or does not have good coverage of the feasible data space which, in turn, creates problems in validation and usage phase. In this paper, we propose a technique for synthesizing feasible and likely data to help balance the classes as well as to boost the performance in terms of confusion matrix as well as overall. The idea, in a nutshell, is to synthesize data samples in close vicinity to the actual data samples specifically for the less represented (minority) classes. This has also implications to the so-called fairness of machine learning. In this paper, we propose a specific method for synthesizing data in a way to balance the classes and boost the performance, especially of the minority classes. It is generic and can be applied to different base algorithms, for example, support vector machines, k-nearest neighbour classifiers deep neural, rule-based classifiers, decision trees, and so forth. The results demonstrated that (a) a significantly more balanced (and fair) classification results can be achieved and (b) that the overall performance as well as the performance per class measured by confusion matrix can be boosted. In addition, this approach can be very valuable for the cases when the number of actual available labelled data is small which itself is one of the problems of the contemporary machine learning.

AB  - Face presentation attack detection (PAD) plays a pivotal role in securing face recognition systems against spoofing attacks. Although great progress has been made in designing face PAD methods, developing a model that can generalize well to unseen test domains remains a significant challenge. Moreover, due to the different types of spoofing attacks, creating a dataset with a sufficient number of samples for training deep neural networks is a laborious task. This work proposes a comprehensive solution that combines synthetic data generation and deep ensemble learning to enhance the generalization capabilities of face PAD. Specifically, synthetic data is generated by blending a static image with spatiotemporal-encoded images using alpha composition and video distillation. In this way, we simulate motion blur with varying alpha values, thereby generating diverse subsets of synthetic data that contribute to a more enriched training set. Furthermore, multiple base models are trained on each subset of synthetic data using stacked ensemble learning. This allows the models to learn complementary features and representations from different synthetic subsets. The meta-features generated by the base models are used as input for a new model called the meta-model. The latter combines the predictions from the base models, leveraging their complementary information to better handle unseen target domains and enhance overall performance. Experimental results from seven datasets-WMCA, CASIA-SURF, OULU-NPU, CASIA-MFSD, Replay-Attack, MSU-MFSD, and SiW-Mv2-highlight the potential to enhance presentation attack detection by using large-scale synthetic data and a stacking-based ensemble approach.

AB  - Machine vision systems with programmed text detection and text recognition features are useful in manufacturing process to automatically locate and read text markings on mounted printed circuit board (PCB) components. To better handle input images with varying image quality, text quality, and text variations, the robustness of deep learning approach for end-to-end text spotting on PCB component images is worth exploring. However, limitations of public PCB component datasets for such research and imbalance of data in actual collected PCB component datasets hinder the training of deep learning text spotting model, and consequently necessitate the generation of synthetic data. In this study, a synthetic PCB component dataset is generated using our synthetic data generator that adds synthetic text with random character sequences on manually edited PCB component images to elevate the realism of the synthetic images. The synthetic dataset covers 66 character classes while providing synthetic text with diverse text variations in font, style, size, and color. We train an existing text spotting model called Text Perceptron using both real and synthetic datasets to detect and recognize arbitrary-shaped text markings on PCB components. Our synthetic PCB component dataset has improved the text spotting performance of Text Perceptron. The trained model achieves promising text detection result and encouraging end-to-end text spotting F-score on real PCB component images. It also meets an acceptable average inference time per image. Still, the text spotting performance of the trained model needs improvement to realize deployment for PCB component inspection.

AB  - A recommender system (RecSys) is a smart solution that offers personalized items to users. Utilizing adequate information from historical transactions in the tourism industry such as items, users, ratings, and reviews becomes valuable input in providing personalized RecSys regarding smart decision-making for users in tourism. This study proposes a new approach for tourism RecSys development through a hybrid model combining User-Based Collaborative Filtering (UBCF), Demographic Filtering (DF), Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA), and Content-Boosted Collaborative Filtering (CBCF). This model utilizes six steps in the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM): business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modeling, evaluation, and deployment. A tourism dataset has been produced by combining raw data from the TripAdvisor website with demographic information from Google Maps to enhance user profiles. The model performance was evaluated using the measurement of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) through the 5 cycles of 10-Fold Cross Validation. Based on the average results of MAE and RMSE, CBCF has achieved performance improvements respectively at 84.7% and 82.3% compared to the performance of UBCF using 100% dense UI-Matrix. This study has succeeded in proposing a novelty model for tourism recommender systems in avoiding the cold-start problem and sparse matrix reduction through the synthetic data generation regarding performance improvement of the recommender system complemented with related aspects of recommended attractions.

AB  - A new deep learning algorithm for performing anomaly detection and multi-class classification with explainability using counterfactuals is described. The system is a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with a modified loss function and new methods for counterfactual identification. An additional hinge-loss term is added to VAE training. This enables convenient synthetic data generation and allows straightforward construction of multi-class counterfactuals. Counterfactuals are synthetic data generated to explain system decisions by answering the question: "If this data was not anomalous or was in another class, what modifications would need to be made?"
   To determine counterfactuals, a path is determined through the embedding space via adversarial attack-like techniques to minimize reconstruction error, with the restriction of minimally altering the number of columns changed. Large changes are allowed, unlike adversarial attack approaches, so changes are isolated and easily visible. Anomaly detection is performed by modifying a result to lower its anomalousness. Classification changes are performed by modifying the data to another class.
   Multi-class classification is performed on the embedding space of the VAE via an attached linear support vector machine (SVM). By adding the hinge-loss term to the VAE embedding training as well as the SVM, the embedding is modified to prefer class separation without being informed of the specific class labels. This causes the classes in the embedding space to be separated by hyperplanes, making counterfactual generation convenient and SVM classification accurate. Accuracy is shown to be comparable to other deep learners. Approaches to accommodating the image and time-series data are discussed.

AB  - Deep learning (DL)-based defect detection provides various robust automated solutions for maintaining the daily operations of electric multiple units (EMUs). However, a sophisticated detection model typically requires extensive, high-quality data. Therefore, effective detection of certain low-frequency defects can be challenging because it is impractical to collect a sufficient amount of data. To address the lack of targeted training data, a novel synthetic dataset generation method for defect detection of EMUs is proposed based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) and a 3-D CRH380A model. By using synthetic data, defect detection accuracy is significantly improved, even when the scope of real data is limited. The synthetic dataset is employed in this article to train three DL detection models (YOLO v5, Mask R-CNN, and TOOD), and comprehensive experiments are conducted to verify the proposed DefectGAN. The experimental results illustrate that the mixed dataset (synthetic and real data) can significantly improve defect detection accuracy for EMUs with limited data. With a few dozen real images, only mixing the synthetic images generated by the proposed DefectGAN into training datasets can increase the F1 score from 0 to 0.8. This work will significantly improve the accuracy of defect detection of existing trouble of moving EMU detection system (TEDS) during data scarcity, facilitate automated operation and maintenance of EMUs, and reduce overall operating costs.

AB  - To train deep learning models for vision-based action recognition of elders' daily activities, we need large-scale activity datasets acquired under various daily living environments and conditions. However, most public datasets used in human action recognition either differ from or have limited coverage of elders' activities in many aspects, making it challenging to recognize elders' daily activities well by only utilizing existing datasets. Recently, such limitations of available datasets have actively been compensated by generating synthetic data from realistic simulation environments and using those data to train deep learning models. In this paper, based on these ideas we develop ElderSim, an action simulation platform that can generate synthetic data on elders' daily activities. For 55 kinds of frequent daily activities of the elders, ElderSim generates realistic motions of synthetic characters with various adjustable data-generating options and provides different output modalities including RGB videos, two- and three-dimensional skeleton trajectories. We then generate KIST SynADL, a large-scale synthetic dataset of elders' activities of daily living, from ElderSim and use the data in addition to real datasets to train three state-of-the-art human action recognition models. From the experiments following several newly proposed scenarios that assume different real and synthetic dataset configurations for training, we observe a noticeable performance improvement by augmenting our synthetic data. We also offer guidance with insights for the effective utilization of synthetic data to help recognize elders' daily activities.

AB  - Question Answering (QA) has become a foundational research area in Natural Language Understanding (NLU) with widespread applications in search, personal digital assistance, and conversational systems. Despite the success in open-domain question answering, existing extractive question answering models pre-trained using Wikipedia articles (e.g., SQuAD data) perform rather poorly in closed-domain and industrial scenarios. Further, a major limitation in adapting question answering systems to such contexts is the poor availability and the expensive annotation of domain-specific data. Thus, wide applicability of QA models are severely hampered in enterprise systems. In this paper, we aim to address the above challenges by introducing a novel QA framework, Qasar, using self-supervised learning for efficient domain adaptation. We show, for the first time, the advantage of finetuning pre-trained QA models for closed-domains by synthetically generated domain-specific questions and answers (from relevant documents) from large language models like T5. Further, we also propose a novel context retrieval component based on question-context semantic relatedness to further boost the accuracy of the Qasar QA framework. Experimental results show significant performance improvements on both openand closed-domain QA datasets, while requiring no labelling efforts, which we believe will contribute to the ease of deployment of such systems in enterprise settings. The different modules of our framework (synthetic data generation, context retrieval, and question answering) can be fully reproduced by fine-tuning publicly available language models and QA models on SQuAD dataset as discussed in the paper.

AB  - Despite the recent advancement in speech emotion recognition (SER) within a single corpus setting, the performance of these SER systems degrades significantly for cross-corpus and cross-language scenarios. The key reason is the lack of generalisation in SER systems towards unseen conditions, which causes them to perform poorly in cross-corpus and cross-language settings. Recent studies focus on utilising adversarial methods to learn domain generalised representation for improving cross-corpus and cross-language SER to address this issue. However, many of these methods only focus on cross-corpus SER without addressing the cross-language SER performance degradation due to a larger domain gap between source and target language data. This contribution proposes an adversarial dual discriminator (ADDi) network that uses the three-players adversarial game to learn generalised representations without requiring any target data labels. We also introduce a self-supervised ADDi (sADDi) network that utilises self-supervised pre-training with unlabelled data. We propose synthetic data generation as a pretext task in sADDi, enabling the network to produce emotionally discriminative and domain invariant representations and providing complementary synthetic data to augment the system. The proposed model is rigorously evaluated using five publicly available datasets in three languages and compared with multiple studies on cross-corpus and cross-language SER. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves improved performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

AB  - Recent studies have shown how synthetic data generation methods can be applied to electronic health records (EHRs) to obtain synthetic versions that do not violate privacy rules. This growing body of research has resulted in the emergence of numerous methods for evaluating the quality of generated data, with new publications often introducing novel evaluation methods. This work presents a detailed review of synthetic EHRs, focusing on the various evaluation methods used to assess the quality of the generated EHRs. We discuss the existing evaluation methods, offering insights into their use as well as providing an interpretation of the evaluation metrics from the perspectives of achieving fidelity, , utility and privacy. . Furthermore, we highlight the key factors influencing the selection of evaluation methods, such as the type of data (e.g., categorical, continuous, or discrete) and the mode of application (e.g., patient level, cohort level, and feature level). To assess the effectiveness of current evaluation measures, we conduct a series of experiments to shed light on the potential limitations of these measures. The findings from these experiments reveal notable shortcomings, including the need for meticulous application of methods to the data to reduce inconsistent evaluations, the qualitative nature of some assessments subject to individual judgment, the need for clinical validations, and the absence of techniques to evaluate temporal dependencies within the data. This highlights the need to place greater emphasis on evaluation measures, their application, and the development of comprehensive evaluation frameworks as it is crucial for advancing progress in this field.

AB  - LiDAR object detection algorithms based on neural networks for autonomous driving require large amounts of data for training, validation, and testing. As real-world data collection and labeling are time-consuming and expensive, simulation-based synthetic data generation is a viable alternative. However, using simulated data for the training of neural networks leads to a domain shift of training and testing data due to differences in scenes, scenarios, and distributions. In this work, we quantify the sim-to-real domain shift by means of LiDAR object detectors trained with a new scenario-identical real-world and simulated dataset. In addition, we answer the questions of how well the simulated data resembles the real-world data and how well object detectors trained on simulated data perform on real-world data. Further, we analyze point clouds at the target-level by comparing real-world and simulated point clouds within the 3D bounding boxes of the targets. Our experiments show that a significant simto-real domain shift exists even for our scenario-identical datasets. This domain shift amounts to an average precision reduction of around 14 % for object detectors trained with simulated data. Additional experiments reveal that this domain shift can be lowered by introducing a simple noise model in simulation. We further show that a simple downsampling method to model real-world physics does not influence the performance of the object detectors.

AB  - This paper provides a methodology for the production of synthetic images for training neural networks to recognise shapes and objects. There are many scenarios in which it is difficult, expensive and even dangerous to produce a set of images that is satisfactory for the training of a neural network. The development of 3D modelling software has nowadays reached such a level of realism and ease of use that it seemed natural to explore this innovative path and to give an answer regarding the reliability of this method that bases the training of the neural network on synthetic images. The results obtained in the two proposed use cases, that of the recognition of a pictorial style and that of the recognition of men at sea, lead us to support the validity of the approach, provided that the work is conducted in a very scrupulous and rigorous manner, exploiting the full potential of the modelling software.

AB  - Drive testing continues to play a key role in mobile network optimization for operators but its high cost is a big concern. Alternative approaches like virtual drive testing (VDT) target device testing in the lab whereas MDT or crowdsourcing based approaches are limited by the incentives users have to participate and contribute measurements. With the aim of augmenting drive testing and significantly reducing its cost, we propose GenDT, a novel deep generative model that synthesizes high-fidelity time series of key radio network key performance indicators (KPIs). The training of GenDT relies on a relatively small amount of real-world measurement data along with corresponding and easily accessible network and environment context data. Through this, GenDT learns the relationship between context and radio network KPIs as they vary over time, and therefore trained GenDT model can subsequently be relied on to generate time series for different KPIs for new drive test routes (trajectories) without having to collect field measurements. GenDT represents an initial attempt at enabling efficient drive testing via generative modeling. Evaluations with real-world mobile network drive testing measurement datasets from two countries demonstrate that GenDT can synthesize significantly more dependable data than a range of baselines. We further show that GenDT has the potential to significantly reduce the drive testing related measurement effort, and that GenDT-generated data yields similar results to that with real data in the context of two downstream use cases QoE prediction and handover analysis.

AB  - Non-destructive testing is a set of techniques for defect detection in materials. While the set of imaging techniques is manifold, ultrasonic imaging is the one used the most. The analysis is mainly performed by human inspectors manually analyzing the acquired images. A low number of defects in real ultrasonic inspections and legal issues concerning data from such inspections make it difficult to obtain proper results from automatic ultrasonic image (B-scan) analysis. The goal of presented research is to obtain an improvement of the detection results by expanding the training data set with realistic synthetic samples. In this paper, we present a novel deep learning Generative Adversarial Network model for generating realistic ultrasonic B-scans with defects in distinct locations. Furthermore, we show that generated B scans can be used for synthetic data augmentation, and can improve the performances of deep convolutional neural object detection networks. Our novel method was developed on a dataset with almost 4000 images and more than 6000 annotated defects. When trained only on real data, detector can achieve an average precision of 70%. By training only on generated data the results increased to 72%, and by mixing generated and real data we achieve almost 76% average precision. We believe that synthetic data generation can generalize to other tasks with limited data. It could also be used for training human personnel. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Stochastic simulation has a prominent position in a variety of scientific domains including those of environmental and water resources sciences. This is due to the numerous applications that can benefit from it, such as risk-related studies. In such domains, stochastic models are typically used to generate synthetic weather data with the desired properties, often resembling those of hydrometeorological observations, which are then used to drive deterministic models of the understudy system. However, generating synthetic weather data with the desired properties is not an easy task. This is due to the peculiarities of such processes, i.e., non-Gaussianity, intermittency, dependence, and periodicity, and the limited availability of open-source software for such purposes. This work aims to simplify the synthetic data generation procedure by providing an R-package calledanySim, specifically designed for the simulation of non-Gaussian correlated random variables, stochastic processes at single and multiple temporal scales, and random fields. The functionality of the package is demonstrated through seven simulation studies, accompanied by code snippets, which resemble real-world cases of stochastic simulation (i.e., generation of synthetic weather data) of hydrometeorological processes and fields (e.g., rainfall, streamflow, temperature, etc.), across several spatial and temporal scales (ranging from annual down to 10-min simulations).

KW  - Smart farming
AB  - In this study, we propose the use of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate synthetic data for crop recommendation (CR). CR is critical in agriculture, assisting farmers in making informed decisions about crop cultivation, considering factors like soil conditions, weather patterns etc. Unfortunately, the availability of labeled data for CR is often limited, posing a significant challenge in training accurate recommendation models. VAEs and GANs are employed to create synthetic data that closely mirrors real-world crop data. VAEs are utilized to extract latent representation from the input data, enabling the generation of new samples with similar characteristics. GANs play a crucial role in generating data by training a generator network to produce synthetic samples that closely resemble real data, while a discriminator network distinguishes between genuine and synthetic data. The generated synthetic data serves as a valuable resource to prepare datasets for CR, enhancing the performance of recommendation models. Our research explores the effectiveness of VAEs and GANs in producing high-quality synthetic CR data, facilitating improved training and evaluation of recommendation systems. This paper presents the architecture and training process of the proposed models and evaluates the quality and utility of the generated synthetic data using various experiments, including visualizations such as heatmaps, scatter plots, cumulative sum per feature plots, and distribution per feature plots. The results of this study hold the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of agriculture by providing a reliable and abundant source of training data for CR systems.

AB  - This paper presents the initial data analysis and modelling for detecting health changes from data gathered on a low-cost smartphone used during normal daily activities. The work is part of the ENVELLINT project, where one of the main objectives is to explore if it is possible to evaluate the functional aspects of frailty indices automatically using smartphones.
   The project involves both longitudinal and cross-sectional studies involving elderly participants. In the longitudinal study a comprehensive set of sensor, application and other smartphone data is gathered over lengthy periods for each participant, together with extensive medical assessments. The purpose is to provide a comprehensive data set for investigating frailty and health changes. The larger cross-sectional study, which included only the medical assessments, was necessary to gather more medical related health and frailty data, and to balance project costs.
   The analysis work to date has involved data and feature engineering to identify, extract and select the most useful features. Insights are given for the potential use of the location and application usage features.
   A core aspect, given the expense and the limited number of participants in the longitudinal study, is to explore the use of synthetic data generation to leverage the real data from both studies. Generative Adversarial Network and Gaussian Copula models have been investigated to create a larger representative dataset of longitudinal participants. Initial results and insights show generated synthetic data that closely mirrors the real data, especially using Gaussian Copula.

AB  - Following the advances in convolutional neural networks and synthetic data generation, 3D egocentric body pose estimations from a mounted fisheye camera have been developed. Previous works estimated 3D joint positions from raw image pixels and intermediate supervision during the process. The mounted fisheye camera captures notably different images that are affected by the optical properties of the lens, angle of views, and setup positions. Therefore, 3D ego-pose estimation from a mounted fisheye camera must be trained for each set of camera optics and setup. We propose a 3D ego-pose estimation from a single mounted omnidirectional camera that captures the entire circumference by back-to-back dual fisheye cameras. The omnidirectional camera can capture the user's body in the 360(circle) field of view under a wide variety of motions. We also propose a simple feed-forward network model to estimate 3D joint positions from 2D joint locations. The lift-up model can be used in real time yet obtains accuracy comparable to those of previous works on our new dataset. Moreover, our model is trainable with the ground truth 3D joint positions and the unit vectors toward the 3D joint positions, which are easily generated from existing publicly available 3D mocap datasets. This advantage alleviates the data collection and training burden due to changes in the camera optics and setups, although it is limited to the effect after the 2D joint location estimation.

AB  - Predicting and understanding human motion dynamics has many applications, such as motion synthesis, augmented reality, security, and autonomous vehicles. Due to the recent success of generative adversarial networks (GAN), there has been much interest in probabilistic estimation and synthetic data generation using deep neural network architectures and learning algorithms.
   We propose a novel sequence-to-sequence model for probabilistic human motion prediction, trained with a modified version of improved Wasserstein generative adversarial networks (WGAN-GP), in which we use a custom loss function designed for human motion prediction. Our model, which we call HP-GAN, learns a probability density function of future human poses conditioned on previous poses. It predicts multiple sequences of possible future human poses, each from the same input sequence but a different vector z drawn from a random distribution. Furthermore, to quantify the quality of the non-deterministic predictions, we simultaneously train a motion-quality-assessment model that learns the probability that a given skeleton sequence is a real human motion.
   We test our algorithm on two of the largest skeleton datasets: NTURGB-D and Human3.6M. We train our model on both single and multiple action types. Its predictive power for long-term motion estimation is demonstrated by generating multiple plausible futures of more than 30 frames from just 10 frames of input. We show that most sequences generated from the same input have more than 50% probabilities of being judged as a real human sequence. We published all the code used in this paper to https://github.com/ebarsoum/hpgan.

AB  - Algorithmic evaluation is a vital step in developing new approaches to machine learning and relies on the availability of existing datasets. However, real-world datasets often do not cover the necessary complexity space required to understand an algorithm's domains of competence. As such, the generation of synthetic datasets to fill gaps in the complexity space has gained attention, offering a means of evaluating algorithms when data is unavail-able. Existing approaches to complexity-focused data generation are limited in their ability to generate solutions that invoke similar classification behaviour to real data. The present work proposes a novel method (Sy:Boid) for complexity-based synthetic data generation, adapting and extending the Boid algorithm that was originally intended for computer graphics simulations. Sy:Boid embeds the modified Boid algorithm within an evolutionary multi-objective optimisation algorithm to generate synthetic datasets which satisfy prede-fined magnitudes of complexity measures. Sy:Boid is evaluated and compared to labelling -based and sampling-based approaches to data generation to understand its ability to gen-erate a wide variety of realistic datasets. Results demonstrate Sy:Boid is capable of gener-ating datasets across a greater portion of the complexity space than existing approaches. Furthermore, the produced datasets were observed to invoke very similar classification behaviours to that of real data.(c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - COVID-19 is a disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The COVID-19 virus spreads when a person comes into contact with an affected individual. This is mainly through drops of saliva or nasal discharge. Most of the affected people have mild symptoms while some people develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which damages organs like the lungs and heart. Chest X-rays (CXRs) have been widely used to identify abnormalities that help in detecting the COVID-19 virus. They have also been used as an initial screening procedure for individuals highly suspected of being infected. However, the availability of radiographic CXRs is still scarce. This can limit the performance of deep learning (DL) based approaches for COVID-19 detection. To overcome these limitations, in this work, we developed an Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Network (ACGAN), to generate CXRs. Each generated X-ray belongs to one of the two classes COVID-19 positive or normal. To ensure the goodness of the synthetic images, we performed some experimentation on the obtained images using the latest Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect COVID-19 in the CXRs. We fine-tuned the models and achieved more than 98% accuracy. After that, we also performed feature selection using the Harmony Search (HS) algorithm, which reduces the number of features while retaining classification accuracy. We further release a GAN-generated dataset consisting of 500 COVID-19 radiographic images.

AB  - Pine Wilt Disease (PWD) is a devastating disease that affects forest ecosystems and has no known cure. Early detection is essential for suppressing infections of PWD. Recent efforts have focused on leveraging deep learning-based algorithms for the early detection of PWD. However, data collection, labeling, and quality assurance for such a method are costly and challenging. Particularly for PWD, the data collection period is limited, restricting the diversity of the dataset. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces a virtual forest considering PWD created using 3D rendering tools, from which we built a synthetic dataset. Furthermore, to ensure the resemblance of the synthetic data to the real data, we employed Image-toImage (I2I) translation techniques. We used the EfficientNetv2-S model to compare the results from each dataset. We were able to confirm the potential of our model trained solely on the PWD synthetic dataset for real PWD detection. Moreover, the model trained on an ensemble comprising both real and synthetic data exhibited improved performance, achieving an F1 Score of 92.88%. Using the I2I translation technique for an ensemble of real and synthetic data also demonstrated enhanced performance. This result confirms the validity and practicality of the synthetic data proposed in this study. The findings of this study are expected to contribute to the broader forest ecosystem preservation and agricultural management by extending to other forest disease detection and agricultural fields.

AB  - Technological innovations, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), have the potential to expedite the goal of precision medicine, especially when combined with increased capacity for voluminous data from multiple sources and expanded therapeutic modalities; however, they also present several challenges. In this communication, we first discuss the goals of precision medicine, and contextualize the use of AI in precision medicine by showcasing innovative applications (e.g., prediction of tumor growth and overall survival, biomarker identification using biomedical images, and identification of patient population for clinical practice) which were presented during the February 2023 virtual public workshop entitled "Application of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for Precision Medicine," hosted by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and University of Maryland Center of Excellence in Regulatory Science and Innovation (M-CERSI). Next, we put forward challenges brought about by the multidisciplinary nature of AI, particularly highlighting the need for AI to be trustworthy. To address such challenges, we subsequently note practical approaches, viz., differential privacy, synthetic data generation, and federated learning. The proposed strategies - some of which are highlighted presentations from the workshop - are for the protection of personal information and intellectual property. In addition, methods such as the risk-based management approach and the need for an agile regulatory ecosystem are discussed. Finally, we lay out a call for action that includes sharing of data and algorithms, development of regulatory guidance documents, and pooling of expertise from a broad-spectrum of stakeholders to enhance the application of AI in precision medicine.

AB  - High-fidelity physics-based models are required to comprehend battery behavior at various operating condi-tions. This paper proposes an uncertainty quantification analysis on a coupled electrochemical-thermal aging model to improve the reliability of a battery model, while also investigating the impact of parametric model uncertainties on battery voltage, temperature, and aging. The coupled model's high computing cost, however, is a significant barrier to perform uncertainty quantification (UQ) and sensitivity analysis (SA). To address this problem, a surrogate model - i.e, by simulating the outcome of a quantity of interest that cannot be easily computed or measured - based on the Gaussian process regression (GPR) theory and principle component analysis (PCA) is built, using a small collection of finite element simulation results as synthetic training data. In total, 43 variable electrochemical-thermal parameters as well as 13 variable aging parameters are studied and estimated. Moreover, the trained surrogate model is also used in the parameterization of the electrochemical and thermal models. The results show that the uncertainties in the input parameters significantly affect the estimations of battery voltage, temperature, and aging. Based on this sensitivity analysis, the most influential parameters affecting the above mentioned battery outputs are reported. This approach is thereby helpful for developing robust and reliable high-fidelity battery aging models with potential applications in digital twins as well as for synthetic data generation.

AB  - The survey paper summarizes the recent applications and developments in the domain of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) i.e. a back propagation based neural network architecture for generative modeling. GANs is one of the most highlighted research avenue due to its synthetic data generation capabilities and benefits of representations comprehended irrespective of the application. While several reviews for GANs in the arena of image processing have been conducted by present but none have given attention on the review of GANs over multi-disciplinary domains. Therefore, in this survey, use of GAN in multidisciplinary applications areas and its implementation challenges have been done by conducting a rigorous search for journal/research article related to GAN and in this regard five renowned journal databases i.e. "ACM Digital Library"," Elsevier", "IEEE Explore", "Science Direct", "Springer" and proceedings of best domain specific conference are considered. By employing hybrid research methodology and article inclusion and exclusion criteria, 100 research articles are considered encompassing 23 application domains for the survey. In this paper applications of GAN in various practical domain and their implementation challenges its associated advantages and disadvantages have been discussed. For the first time a survey of this type have been done where GAN with wide range of application and its associated advantages and disadvantages issue have been reviewed. Finally, this article presents several diversified prominent developing trends in the respective research domain which will provide a visionary perspective regarding ongoing GANs related research and eventually help to develop an intuition for problem solving using GANs.

AB  - PURPOSE There is strong interest from patients, researchers, the pharmaceutical industry, medical journal editors, funders of research, and regulators in sharing clinical trial data for secondary analysis. However, data access remains a challenge because of concerns about patient privacy. It has been argued that synthetic data generation (SDG) is an effective way to address these privacy concerns. There is a dearth of evidence supporting this on oncology clinical trial data sets, and on the utility of privacy-preserving synthetic data. The objective of the proposed study is to validate the utility and privacy risks of synthetic clinical trial data sets across multiple SDG techniques.
   METHODS We synthesized data sets from eight breast cancer clinical trial data sets using three types of generative models: sequential synthesis, conditional generative adversarial network, and variational autoencoder. Synthetic data utility was evaluated by replicating the published analyses on the synthetic data and assessing concordance of effect estimates and CIs between real and synthetic data. Privacy was evaluated by measuring attribution disclosure risk and membership disclosure risk.
   RESULTS Utility was highest using the sequential synthesis method where all results were replicable and the CI overlap most similar or higher for seven of eight data sets. Both types of privacy risks were low across all three types of generative models.
   DISCUSSION Synthetic data using sequential synthesis methods can act as a proxy for real clinical trial data sets, and simultaneously have low privacy risks. This type of generative model can be one way to enable broader sharing of clinical trial data.

AB  - With the advent of modern smart grid networks, advanced metering infrastructure provides real-time information from smart meters (SM) and sensors to energy companies and consumers. The smart grid is indeed a paradigm that is enabled by the Internet of Things (IoT) and in which the SM acts as an IoT device that collects and transmits data over the Internet to enable intelligent applications. However, IoT data communicated over the smart grid could however be maliciously altered, resulting in energy theft due to unbilled energy consumption. Machine learning (ML) techniques for energy theft detection (ETD) based on IoT data are promising but are nonetheless constrained by the poor quality of data and particularly its imbalanced nature (which emerges from the dominant representation of honest users and poor representation of the rare theft cases). Leading ML-based ETD methods employ synthetic data generation to balance the training the dataset. However, these are trained to maximise average correct detection instead of ETD. In this work, we formulate an energy-aware evaluation framework that guides the model training to maximise ETD and minimise the revenue loss due to mis-classification. We propose a convolution neural network with positive bias (CNN-B) and another with focal loss CNN (CNN-FL) to mitigate the data imbalance impact. These outperform the state of the art and the CNN-B achieves the highest ETD and the minimum revenue loss with a loss reduction of 30.4% compared to the highest loss incurred by these methods.

AB  - While optical character recognition has attracted considerable interest from researchers in recent times, automating font identification in printed / scanned documents is still not a well explored problem. With the increasing variety of fonts in the open community, identifying the different fonts used in a given document image can often provide important visual cues for document understanding. Font identification is a challenging task owing to smaller inter-class variations and limited availability of labeled image data for a large variety of font images. In the absence of the original true type format (ttf) files, even synthetic data generation is not possible. To this end, we propose to utilize recent few-shot learning techniques like prototypical networks for font identification in scanned / printed document images using character images from different fonts as input for scarce data scenarios and call the proposed method Font-ProtoNet. This approach uses an initial set of classes to learn an embedding and centroid representations (as class prototypes), that are used to classify novel samples based on euclidean distance. We demonstrate that Font-ProtoNet gives encouraging results by training prototypical networks in few-shot learning settings on a synthetic dataset of 200 font classes and using the trained network to identify fonts on a synthetic dataset of 100 novel font classes. We have also tested our approach on the real-world Adobe Visual Font Recognition (AdobeVFR) dataset and obtained 59.86% and 71.01% word-level accuracy of font identification using 1-shot and 5-shot i.e.,1 and 5 character images per font class, respectively.

AB  - Transient stability prediction is essential for maintaining the reliability and integrity of power systems. In recent studies, deep learning models have been proposed and extensively utilized in predicting the transient stability for both off-line and online purposes with less emphasis on the quality of training datasets used in their methods. However, the use of machine learning-based classifiers to predict the transient stability of power systems necessitates carefully chosen datasets for training, since the prediction accuracy of the classifiers strongly depends on the quality and class distribution of these datasets. In most cases, the datasets generated for training the classifiers are unbalanced, because power systems are usually planned to be operating securely against most of the credible contingencies. Therefore, the imbalance between the stable and unstable instances generated for those operating conditions results in mispredictions of the unstable instances to a larger extent. In this study, the class balance of datasets generated for two test systems of different scales is investigated, and a novel method is proposed for improving the balance qualities of these datasets. The method is compared with the most commonly used approaches for data imbalance problems, including the adaptive synthetic sample generation approach (ADASYN), and the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). It is shown that the stability prediction performance of the recurrent neural network-based classifiers, such as long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU), and echo state network (ESN), are improved when they are trained using the proposed sampling method.

AB  - Convolutional neural networks generally require considerable amount of data for training to perform adequately well in all real-world scenarios. Many times, the data for all scenarios is hard to collect and ground truth annotation is also a challenge. Similar problem exists in training networks for the autonomous vehicles given the diverse weather conditions where these cars are expected to be driven. Thus, a synthetic data generation model is imperative and we go about building a weather simulation framework. This framework is intended to generate weather conditions over different driving scenarios. To start with, we go about implementing a completely configurable rain/fog/windshield simulation model. The scope of this framework, however is much more than these three models. Apart from refining these models further as and when need, we intend to build in mechanisms to simulate more diverse weather conditions within this framework.
   There are multiple challenges in the implementation of these models. To begin with, we need a mechanism to simulate diverse weather conditions in a driving environment. One method could be to simulate the entire 3D environment, with the roads, automobiles, and an artificial world, but this approach would be extremely challenging both in terms of the realism that can be achieved, and in terms of the time it would take for the implementation. Another method is to overlay the rain/fog effect on top of pre-rendered videos. This 2D overlaying technique is a practical solution, since there exist many driving videos at our disposal. In this paper, we outline methods to implement this effectively, and showcase the results obtained in training a Neural Network with this approach.

AB  - The observations used to classify data from real systems often vary as a result of changing operating conditions (e.g. velocity, load, temperature, etc.). Hence, to create accurate classification algorithms for these systems, observations from a large number of operating conditions must be used in algorithm training. This can be an arduous, expensive, and even dangerous task. Treating an operating condition as an inherently metric continuous variable (e.g. velocity, load or temperature) and recognizing that observations at a single operating condition can be viewed as a data cluster enables formulation of interpolation techniques. This paper presents a method that uses data clusters at operating conditions where data has been collected to estimate data clusters at other operating conditions, enabling classification. The mathematical tools that are key to the proposed data cluster interpolation method are Catmull-Rom splines, the Schur decomposition, singular value decomposition, and a special matrix interpolation function. The ability of this method to accurately estimate distribution, orientation and location in the feature space is then shown through three benchmark problems involving 2D feature vectors. The proposed method is applied to empirical data involving vibration-based terrain classification for an autonomous robot using a feature vector of dimension 300, to show that these estimated data clusters are more effective for classification purposes than known data clusters that correspond to different operating conditions. Ultimately, it is concluded that although collecting real data is ideal, these estimated data clusters can improve classification accuracy when it is inconvenient or difficult to collect additional data.

AB  - This article addresses the classification of fatigue crack length using artificial intelligence (AI) applied to acoustic emission (AE) signals. The AE signals were collected during fatigue testing of two specimen types. One specimen type had a 1-mm hole for crack initiation. The other specimen type had a 150-mu m wide slit of various lengths. Fatigue testing was performed under stress intensity factor control to moderate crack advancement. The slit specimen produced AE signals only from crack advancement at the slit tips, whereas the 1-mm hole specimens produced AE signals from both crack tip advancement and crack rubbing or clapping. The AE signals were captured with a piezoelectric wafer active sensor (PWAS) array connected to MISTRAS instrumentation and aewin software. The collected AE signals were preprocessed using time-of-flight filtering and denoising. Choi Williams transform converted time domain AE signals into spectrograms. To apply machine learning, the spectrogram images were used as input data for the training, validation, and testing of a GoogLeNet convolutional neural network (CNN). The CNN was trained to sort the AE signals into crack length classes. CNN performance enhancements, including synthetic data generation and class balancing, were developed. A three-class example with crack lengths of (i) 10-12 mm, (ii) 12-14 mm, and (iii) 14-16 mm is provided. Our AI approach was able to classify the AE signals into these three classes with 91% accuracy, thus proving that the AE signals contain sufficient information for crack estimation using an AI-enabled approach.

AB  - Many organizations are developing connected worker and digital twin solutions in mixed reality as a means to quickly train new hires while simultaneously developing assistive deep learning models for quality-control mechanisms through internal documentation, diagrams, and 3D models. However, the transformation of real-life assets and processes into digital twin counterparts is a multi-step, intensive undertaking, requiring significant domain expertise and technical know-how. Therefore, we explore the architectural and technical components required to transform the most critical assets into a digital twin that yields immediate business value. Specifically, we explore the creation of digitalization architectures with re-usable components for training not only new hires but also deep neural network-based computer vision models. In this work, we present an action research case study guided by the Project Management Body of Knowledge framework. This case study was conducted in coordination with TechnipFMC, a global leader oil and gas company, on the digitalization efforts to transition into their industrial metaverse. We developed multiple architectures to bring assembly practices into a mixed reality training solution usable by trainees and editable by domain experts in real time. Further, we generate synthetic data from the same mixed reality training environments to train object detection models on industrial components and find that the photorealistic 3D models can improve mean average precision on the real-world task by +2.5 mAP.

AB  - Providing access to synthetic micro-data in place of confidential data to protect the privacy of participants is common practice. For the synthetic data to be useful for analysis, it is necessary that the density function of the synthetic data closely approximate the confidential data. Hence, accurately estimating the density function based on sample micro-data is important. Existing kernel-based, copula-based, and machine learning methods of joint density estimation may not be viable. Applying the multivariate moments' problem to sample-based density estimation has long been considered impractical due to the computational complexity and intractability of optimal parameter selection of the density estimate when the true joint density function is unknown. This paper introduces a generalised form of the sample moment-based density estimate, which can be used to estimate joint density functions when only the information of empirical moments is available. We demonstrate optimal parametrisation of the moment-based density estimate based solely on sample data by employing a computational strategy for parameter selection. We compare the performance of the moment-based estimate to that of existing non-parametric and parametric density estimation methods. The results show that using empirical moments can provide a reasonable, robust non-parametric approximation of a joint density function that is comparable to existing non-parametric methods. We provide an example of synthetic data generation from the moment-based density estimate and show that the resulting synthetic data provides a reasonable disclosure-protected alternative for public release.

AB  - Fine-tuning a pretrained model with real data for a machine learning task requires many hours of manual work, especially for computer vision tasks, where collection and annotation of data can be very time-consuming. We present a framework and methodology for synthetic data collection that is not only efficient in terms of time taken to collect and annotate data, making use of free- and open-source software tools and 3D assets but also beats the state-of-the-art against real data, which is the ultimate test for any similar-to-real approach. We test our approach on a set of image classes from ObjectNet, which is a challenging image classification benchmark test dataset that is designed to be similar in many respects to ImageNet but with a wider variety of viewpoints, rotations, and backgrounds, which can make it more difficult for transfer learning problems. The novelty of our approach stems from the way we create complex backgrounds for 3D models using 2D images laid out as decals in a 3D game engine, where synthetic images are captured programmatically with a large number of systematic variations. We demonstrate that our approach is highly effective, resulting in a deep learning model with a top-1 accuracy of 72% on the ObjectNet data, which is a new state-of-the-art result. In addition, we present an efficient strategy for learning rate tuning that is an order of magnitude faster than regular grid search.

AB  - State-of-the-art camera-based deep learning methods for inventory monitoring tend to fail to generalize across different domains due to the high variance of scene settings. Large amounts of human labor are required to label and parameterize the models, making a real-world deployment impractical. In a third-party warehouse setting, supervised learning approaches are either too costly and/or inaccurate to deploy due to the need for human labor to address the diverse set of environmental factors (i.e, lighting conditions, product motion, deployment limitations).
   We introduce PIWIMS, a realistic synthetic dataset generation technique that combines the physical constraints of the scene in real-world deployments, drastically reducing the need for human labeling. In contrast to other generative techniques, where the generative parameters are learned from a large sample of available data, this compositive approach defines the parameters based on physical characteristics of the particular task, which requires minimal human annotation. We demonstrate PIWIMS performance in a 4-month real operating warehouse deployment and show that with only 32 manually labeled images per object, PIWIMS can achieve an accuracy of up to 87% in inventory tracking, which is a 28% increase when compared to traditional data augmentation techniques and 31% error reduction when compared to the third-party warehouse industry average. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of PIWIMS to generalize across different camera angles and positions by achieving an accuracy of 85% in inventory tracking while varying the position and angle of the camera.

AB  - Object detection is increasingly used onboard Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) for various applications; however, the machine learning (ML) models for UAV-based detection are often validated using data curated for tasks unrelated to the UAV application. This is a concern because training neural networks on large-scale benchmarks have shown excellent capability in generic object detection tasks, yet conventional training approaches can lead to large inference errors for UAV-based images. Such errors arise due to differences in imaging conditions between images from UAVs and images in training. To overcome this problem, we characterize boundary conditions of ML models, beyond which the models exhibit rapid degradation in detection accuracy. Our work is focused on understanding the impact of different UAV-based imaging conditions on detection performance by using synthetic data generated using a game engine. Properties of the game engine are exploited to populate the synthetic datasets with realistic and annotated images. Specifically, it enables the fine control of various parameters, such as camera position, view angle, illumination conditions, and object pose. Using the synthetic datasets, we analyze detection accuracy in different imaging conditions as a function of the above parameters. We use three well-known neural network models with different model complexity in our work. In our experiment, we observe and quantify the following: 1) how detection accuracy drops as the camera moves toward the nadir-view region; 2) how detection accuracy varies depending on different object poses, and 3) the degree to which the robustness of the models changes as illumination conditions vary.

AB  - Key value pair (KVP) extraction or Named Entity Recognition (NER) from visually rich documents has been an active area of research in document understanding and data extraction domain. Several transformer based models such as LayoutLMv2 [1], LayoutLMv3 [2], and LiLT [3] have emerged achieving state of the art results. However, addition of even a single new class to the existing model requires (a) re-annotation of entire training dataset to include this new class and (b) retraining the model again. Both of these issues really slow down the deployment of updated model.
   We present ProtoNER: Prototypical Network based end-to-end KVP extraction model that allows addition of new classes to an existing model while requiring minimal number of newly annotated training samples. The key contributions of our model are: (1) No dependency on dataset used for initial training of the model, which alleviates the need to retain original training dataset for longer duration as well as data re-annotation which is very time consuming task, (2) No intermediate synthetic data generation which tends to add noise and results in model's performance degradation, and (3) Hybrid loss function which allows model to retain knowledge about older classes as well as learn about newly added classes.
   Experimental results show that ProtoNER finetuned with just 30 samples is able to achieve similar results for the newly added classes as that of regular model finetuned with 2600 samples.

KW  - BEHAVIOR
AB  - Predicting customer attrition (churn) is a well-known problem in industries that provide services, like financial institutions, telecommunications, e-commerce, and retail. There are two kinds of attrition - active and passive (silent). Active attrition is usually associated with subscription-based business models, commonly seen in telecommunications and internet industries like Netffix. In industries like finance, retail, and e-commerce, we see the other kind of attrition - silent attrition where customers stop doing business without formal notice. This makes the silent attrition prediction problem even more challenging because it is difficult to differentiate between attrited and inactive customers. We focus our work on predicting silent attrition which is still under-explored in the payment card industry (i.e. Mastercard, Visa). The contribution of our work is threefold. First, we present a data-driven approach to define silent attrition as customer inactivity. Second, we discussed multiple procedures to generate synthetic data thereby preserving customers' privacy. At last, we presented a comprehensive view of various machine learning (ML) pathways in which this churn prediction problem can be framed and solved; each requiring a specific feature engineering. We presented experimental results corresponding to each pathway to comparative analysis. We believe that this work to be beneficial to the researchers and ML practitioners who often have to deal with sensitive financial data but have limited permission to use it. In this direction, we demonstrated the use of synthetic data generation to reduce the risk of data leakage and other privacy concerns relating to ML models development.

AB  - Residential energy consumption data and related sociodemographic information are critical for energy demand management, including providing personalized services, ensuring energy supply, and designing demand response programs. However, it is often difficult to collect sufficient data to build machine learning models, primarily due to cost, technical barriers, and privacy. Synthetic data generation becomes a feasible solution to address data availability issues, while most existing work generates data without considering the balance between usability and privacy. In this paper, we first propose a data generation model based on the Wasserstein Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (WDCGAN), which is capable of synthesizing fine-grained energy consumption time series and corresponding sociodemographic information. The WDCGAN model can generate realistic data by balancing data usability and privacy level by setting a hyperparameter during training. Next, we take the classification of sociodemographic information as an application example and train four classical classification models with the generated datasets, including CNN, LSTM, SVM, and LightGBM. We evaluate the pro-posed data generator using Irish data, and the results show that the proposed WDCGAN model can generate realistic load profiles with satisfactory similarity in terms of data distribution, patterns, and performance.

AB  - Augmented and virtual reality deployment is finding increasing use in novel applications. Some of these emerging and foreseen applications allow the users to access sensitive information and functionalities. Head Mounted Displays (HMD) are used to enable such applications and they typically include eye facing cameras to facilitate advanced user interaction. Such integrated cameras capture iris and partial periocular region during the interaction. This work investigates the possibility of using the captured ocular images from integrated cameras from HMD devices for biometric verification, taking into account the expected limited computational power of such devices. Such an approach can allow user to be verified in a manner that does not require any special and explicit user action. In addition to our comprehensive analyses, we present a light weight, yet accurate, segmentation solution for the ocular region captured from HMD devices. Further, we benchmark a number of well-established iris and periocular verification methods along with an in-depth analysis on the impact of iris sample selection and its effect on iris recognition performance for HMD devices. To the end, we also propose and validate an identity preserving synthetic ocular image generation mechanism that can be used for large scale data generation for training purposes or attack generation purposes. We establish the realistic image quality of generated images with high fidelity and identity preserving capabilities through benchmarking them for iris and periocular verification.

AB  - Patient-specific medical image-based computational fluid dynamics has been widely used to reveal fundamental insight into mechanisms of cardiovascular disease, for instance, correlating morphology to adverse vascular remodeling. However, segmentation of medical images is laborious, error-prone, and a bottleneck in the development of large databases that are needed to capture the natural variability in morphology. Instead, idealized models, where morphological features are parameterized, have been used to investigate the correlation with flow features, but at the cost of limited understanding of the complexity of cardiovascular flows. To combine the advantages of both approaches, we developed a tool that preserves the patient-specificness inherent in medical images while allowing for parametric alteration of the morphology. In our open-source framework morphMan we convert the segmented surface to a Voronoi diagram, modify the diagram to change the morphological features of interest, and then convert back to a new surface. In this paper, we present algorithms for modifying bifurcation angles, location of branches, cross-sectional area, vessel curvature, shape of bends, and surface roughness. We show qualitative and quantitative validation of the algorithms, performing with an accuracy exceeding 97% in general, and proof-of-concept on combining the tool with computational fluid dynamics. By combining morphMan with appropriate clinical measurements, one could explore the morphological parameter space and resulting hemodynamic response using only a handful of segmented surfaces, effectively minimizing the main bottleneck in image-based computational fluid dynamics.

AB  - High-resolution rainfall data sequences serve as inputs for a range of applications in planning, design and management of small (mostly urban) water resources systems. These applications include continuous flow simulation, rain water tank design, and the evaluation of alternate policies for assessment of environmental impacts. However, high-resolution rainfall data are often not available, since their measurements are costly and time-consuming. The lack of such data is, therefore, becoming an important issue.
   As direct measurements of high-resolution rainfall data are hardly possible in practice (especially in developing and under-developed countries), a potential alternative may be to try to derive such data from the available low-resolution (daily) ones, through a data transformation procedure. Research on this (rainfall disaggregation) topic has been an important activity in hydrology and water resources over the last two decades. A host of methods have come into the fore as a consequence. Among these, the scaling-based methods seem to have received noticeable attention, essentially for their underlying concept that: the properties of the rainfall process at different scales not only are related to each other (a fundamental requirement for data transformation between such scales) but also are independent of the scale of observation (a desirable property, for data transformation over a wide range of scales).
   In view of this, an attempt is made in the present study to test the utility and suitability of a random cascade scaling-based approach for transformation of rainfall data observed in Sydney, Australia. More specifically, disaggregation of rainfall data from daily scale to finer resolutions is attempted. Four different successively doubled resolutions (daily, 12-hr, 6-hr, and 3-hr) are considered. The analysis involves two systematic steps: (1) identification of the presence of scaling behavior in the rainfall process; and (2) generation of synthetic data possessing same/similar scaling properties of the observed rainfall data. The scaling identification is attempted for two different types of data sets, towards cross-verification and confirmation of presence of scaling: (1) rainfall data at the four individual scales; and (2) distribution of rainfall amounts (i.e. weights) between the successively doubled scales. The statistical moment scaling function method is employed for this purpose. While this is essentially a multi-scaling method, it has a particular advantage that it can distinguish between monoscaling and multi-fractal behaviors. For synthetic data generation, a log-Poisson distribution for the weights (rainfall not used in this step) is assumed, and the scaling behavior (moment scaling function) of the observed weights is considered as the "reference" property.
   The results indicate the presence of multi-scaling behaviors in all the time series analyzed (i.e. rainfall data as well as weights), as convex moment scaling function curves are observed. The synthetic data generated using the log-Poisson distribution is found to exhibit a scaling behavior that matches very well with that for the observed weights. However, the results also indicate that fitting the scaling function alone does not necessarily mean fitting the data. The use of log-Poisson distribution for synthetic data generation is found to possess an important limitation in that it does not generate zero values, which are a common occurrence in high-resolution data. The use of a scaling-based method in itself needs to be cautiously pursued since: such methods are useful only for distinguishing between mono-and multi-scaling behaviors, but not between scaling and non-scaling.
   In light of the present results, future research will focus on comparison of the scaling-based approach with those based on parametric alternating renewal processes, non-parametric fragments, and nonlinear deterministic chaos.

   Dialogue systems have been widely applied in many scenarios and are now more powerful and ubiquitous than ever before. With large neural models and massive available data, current dialogue systems have access to more knowledge than any people in their life. However, current dialogue systems still do not perform at a human level. One major gap between conversational agents and humans lies in their abilities to be aware of social norms. The development of socially-aware dialogue systems is impeded due to the lack of resources. In this paper, we present the first socially-aware dialogue corpus - SocialDial, based on Chinese social culture. SocialDial consists of two parts: 1,563 multi-turn dialogues between two human speakers with fine-grained labels, and 4,870 synthetic conversations generated by ChatGPT. The human corpus covers five categories of social norms, which have 14 sub-categories in total. Specifically, it contains social factor annotations including social relation, context, social distance, and social norms. However, collecting sufficient socially-aware dialogues is costly. Thus, we harness the power of ChatGPT and devise an ontology-based synthetic data generation framework. This framework is able to generate synthetic data at scale. To ensure the quality of synthetic dialogues, we design several mechanisms for quality control during data collection. Finally, we evaluate our dataset using several pre-trained models, such as BERT and RoBERTa. Comprehensive empirical results based on state-of-the-art neural models demonstrate that modeling of social norms for dialogue systems is a promising research direction. To the best of our knowledge, SocialDial is the first socially-aware dialogue dataset that covers multiple social factors and has fine-grained labels.1

AB  - A vast majority of human population around the planet has limited availability to electricity. Inexpensive energy storage systems are crucial for solving this critical issue. Rapid rise in global pollutants has also sparked widespread efforts to limit fossil fuelled automobiles. Lithium-ion batteries continue to be a commanding force in the energy storage domain. Lithium-ion batteries have been consistently used in distributed solar-battery modules as well. Precise prognostics of battery health and remaining shelf life of the battery is a challenging task. Sufficient access to high-quality battery dataset is important to compute accurate State-of-Charge estimations and also to predict end-of-life of the storage system. A data-driven approach is the need of the hour to derive useful insights into battery health and cycle life. Researchers have limited access to battery data chiefly due to privacy concerns. Commercial manufacturers rarely share data, which leads to data scarcity issues. Lack of data leads to ineffective State-of-Charge evaluations as well. This paper aims to provide reasonable solutions to resolve the limited data difficulty faced by battery researchers. The primary contributions of our paper include: (a) we employ a seasonal-trend contrastive learning approach to generate reliable battery synthetic data, (b) heterogeneity of the synthetic data is preserved which helps to improve battery health forecasting. We also release the code implementation details relevant to this research work to enable battery scientists to reproduce and develop upon our work.

AB  - Generating synthetic data is a complex task that necessitates accurately replicating the statistical and mathematical properties of the original data elements. In sectors such as finance, utilizing and disseminating real data for research or model development can pose substantial privacy risks owing to the inclusion of sensitive information. Additionally, authentic data may be scarce, particularly in specialized domains where acquiring ample, varied, and high-quality data is difficult or costly. This scarcity or limited data availability can limit the training and testing of machine-learning models. In this paper, we address this challenge. In particular, our task is to synthesize a dataset with similar properties to an input dataset about the stock market. The input dataset is anonymized and consists of very few columns and rows, contains many inconsistencies, such as missing rows and duplicates, and its values are not normalized, scaled, or balanced. We explore the utilization of generative adversarial networks, a deep-learning technique, to generate synthetic data and evaluate its quality compared to the input stock dataset. Our innovation involves generating artificial datasets that mimic the statistical properties of the input elements without revealing complete information. For example, synthetic datasets can capture the distribution of stock prices, trading volumes, and market trends observed in the original dataset. The generated datasets cover a wider range of scenarios and variations, enabling researchers and practitioners to explore different market conditions and investment strategies. This diversity can enhance the robustness and generalization of machine-learning models. We evaluate our synthetic data in terms of the mean, similarities, and correlations.

AB  - Sharing sensitive data is vital in enabling many modern data analysis and machine learning tasks. However, current methods for data release are insufficiently accurate or granular to provide meaningful utility, and they carry a high risk of deanonymization or membership inference attacks. In this paper, we propose a differentially private synthetic data generation solution with a focus on the compelling domain of location data. We present two methods with high practical utility for generating synthetic location data from real locations, both of which protect the existence and true location of each individual in the original dataset. Our first, partitioning-based approach introduces a novel method for privately generating point data using kernel density estimation, in addition to employing private adaptations of classic statistical techniques, such as clustering, for private partitioning. Our second, network-based approach incorporates public geographic information, such as the road network of a city, to constrain the bounds of synthetic data points and hence improve the accuracy of the synthetic data. Both methods satisfy the requirements of differential privacy, while also enabling accurate generation of synthetic data that aims to preserve the distribution of the real locations. We conduct experiments using three large-scale location datasets to show that the proposed solutions generate synthetic location data with high utility and strong similarity to the real datasets. We highlight some practical applications for our work by applying our synthetic data to a range of location analytics queries, and we demonstrate that our synthetic data produces near-identical answers to the same queries compared to when real data is used. Our results show that the proposed approaches are practical solutions for sharing and analyzing sensitive location data privately.

AB  - Lipid membranes are vital in a wide range of biological and biotechnical systems; they undepin functions from modulation of protein activity to drug uptake and delivery. Understanding the structure, interactions, self-assembly and phase behaviour of lipids is critical to developing a molecular undertanding of biological membrane mediated processes, establishing engineering approaches to biotechnical membrane application development. Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) is the de facto method used to analyse the structure of self-assembled lipid systems. The resultant diffraction patterns are however extremely difficult to assign automatically with researchers spending considerable time often analysing patterns ex situ from a beamline facility, reducing experimental capacity and optimisation. Furthermore, research projects will often focus on particular lipid compositions and thus would benefit significantly from a method which can be rapidly optimised for a range of samples of interest. We present a generalisable machine learning pipeline that is able to classify lipid phases based on their raw, experimental SAXS spectra, with >99% accuracy and an inference time of <60 ms, enabling high throughput on-site analysis. We achieved this through application of a synthetic data generation system, capable of building synthetic SAXS patterns from the underlying physics which dictate phase behaviour, and we also propose an extension of our system to synthetically generate co-existence phase spectra with known composition ratios. Pre-training our machine learning model on this synthetic data, and fine-tuning on experimental samples empowers the model in achieving state-of-the-art, rapid lipid phase classification, allowing researchers to be able to adapt their experiments on site if needed and hence massively accelerate high throughput lipid research.

AB  - Entity resolution (ER), the problem of identifying and linking records that belong to the same real-world entities in structured and unstructured data, is a primary task in data integration. Accurate and efficient ER has a major practical impact on various applications across commercial, security and scientific domains. Recently, scalable ER techniques have received enormous attention with the increasing need to combine large-scale datasets. The shortage of training and ground truth data impedes the development and testing of ER algorithms. Good public datasets, especially those containing personal information, are restricted in this area and usually small in size. Due to privacy and confidential issues, testing algorithms or techniques with real datasets is challenging in ER research. Simulation is one technique for generating synthetic datasets that have characteristics similar to those of real data for testing algorithms. Many existing simulation tools in ER lack support for generating large-scale data and have problems in complexity, scalability, and limitations of resampling. In our work, we propose a simple, inexpensive, and fast synthetic data generation tool. Our tool only generates entity names in the first stage, but these are commonly used as identification keys in ER algorithms. We avoid the detail-level simulation of entity names using a simple vector representation that delivers simplicity and efficiency. In this paper, we discuss how to simulate simple vectors that approximate the properties of entity names. We describe the overall construction of the tool based on data analysis of a namespace that contains entity names collected from the actual environment.

AB  - Terrain representation is a basic topic in the field of interactive graphics. The amount of data required for a good quality of the terrain offers an important challenge to developers of such systems. For users of these applications, the accuracy of geographical data is generally less important than its natural visual appearance. This makes it possible to maintain a limited geographical database for the system and to extend it generating synthetic data. The evaluation of the intrinsic properties of the terrain (i.e. fractal dimension, roughness, etc.) may be used as the basis for generating extra data accomplishing the same patterns discovered in the actual information. However, it is also interesting to point out that in most natural landscapes, it is usual to have human or natural changes in the basic properties of some areas, i.e. a road or a river. This fact can make it more difficult for synthetic data generation to be free of visual artifacts within these areas. In this paper, we combine fractal and wavelet theories to provide extra data which keeps the natural properties of actual information available. New levels of detail for the terrain are obtained by applying an inverse Wavelet Transform to a set of values randomly generated, thus maintaining the coherence of statistical properties with the original geographical data. Combined with this approach, the use of energy reduction masks has been added in order to avoid undesired visual artifacts in those special areas for which the general terrain properties are no longer valid.

AB  - Digital transformation is omnipresent in our daily lives and its impact is noticeable through new technologies, like smart devices, AI-Chatbots or the changing work environment. This digitalization also takes place in product development, with the integration of many technologies, such as Industry 4.0, digital twins or data-driven methods, to improve the quality of new products and to save time and costs during the development process. Therefore, the use of data-driven methods reusing existing data has great potential. However, data from product design are very diverse and strongly depend on the respective development phase. One of the first few product representations are sketches and drawings, which represent the product in a simplified and condensed way. But, to reuse the data, the existing sketches must be found with an automated approach, allowing the contained information to be utilized. One approach to solve this problem is presented in this paper, with the detection of principle sketches in the early phase of the development process. The aim is to recognize the symbols in these sketches automatically with object detection models. Therefore, existing approaches were analyzed and a new procedure developed, which uses synthetic training data generation. In the next step, a total of six different data generation types were analyzed and tested using six different one- and two-stage detection models. The entire procedure was then evaluated on two unknown test datasets, one focusing on different gearbox variants and a second dataset derived from CAD assemblies. In the last sections the findings are discussed and a procedure with high detection accuracy is determined.

AB  - question-answering (QA) has emerged as a prominent area in Natural Language Processing (NLP) due to its ability to produce concise and human-like responses, particularly with the advancement of Large Language Models. Despite its potential, abstractive QA suffers from challenges like the need for extensive training data and the generation of incorrect entities and out-of-context words in the responses. In safety- critical domains like medical and clinical settings, such issues are unacceptable and may compromise the accuracy and reliability of generated answers. We proposed KI-MAG (Knowledge-Infused Medical Abstractive Generator) model, a novel Knowledge-Infused Abstractive Question Answering System specifically designed for the medical domain. KI-MAG aims to address the aforementioned limitations and enhance the correctness of generated responses while mitigating data sparsity concerns. The KI-MAG system produces more precise and informative answers by incorporating relevant medical entities into the model's generation process. Furthermore, we adopt a synthetic data generation approach using question-answer pairs to overcome the challenge of limited training data in the medical domain. These synthetic pairs augment the original dataset, resulting in better model generalization and improved performance. Our extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the KI-MAG system. Compared to traditional abstractive QA models, our approach exhibits a substantial increase of approximately 15% in Blue-1, Blue-2, Blue-3, and Blue-4 scores, indicating a remarkable improvement in answer accuracy and overall quality of responses. Overall, our Knowledge-Infused Abstractive Question Answering System in the Medical Domain (KI-MAG) presents a promising solution to enhance the performance and reliability of abstractive QA models in safety-critical medical applications where precision and correctness of answers are of utmost importance.

AB  - BackgroundIn silico testing of novel image reconstruction and quantitative algorithms designed for interventional imaging requires realistic high-resolution modeling of arterial trees with contrast dynamics. Furthermore, data synthesis for training of deep learning algorithms requires that an arterial tree generation algorithm be computationally efficient and sufficiently random. PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to provide a method for anatomically and physiologically motivated, computationally efficient, random hepatic arterial tree generation. MethodsThe vessel generation algorithm uses a constrained constructive optimization approach with a volume minimization-based cost function. The optimization is constrained by the Couinaud liver classification system to assure a main feeding artery to each Couinaud segment. An intersection check is included to guarantee non-intersecting vasculature and cubic polynomial fits are used to optimize bifurcation angles and to generate smoothly curved segments. Furthermore, an approach to simulate contrast dynamics and respiratory and cardiac motion is also presented. Results: The proposed algorithm can generate a synthetic hepatic arterial tree with 40 000 branches in 11 s. The high-resolution arterial trees have realistic morphological features such as branching angles (MAD with Murray's law =1.2 +/- 1.2o, radii (median Murray deviation =0.08, and smoothly curved, non-intersecting vessels. Furthermore, the algorithm assures a main feeding artery to each Couinaud segment and is random (variability = 0.98 +/- 0.01). ConclusionsThis method facilitates the generation of large datasets of high-resolution, unique hepatic angiograms for the training of deep learning algorithms and initial testing of novel 3D reconstruction and quantitative algorithms designed for interventional imaging.

AB  - The increasing availability and use of sensitive personal data raises a set of issues regarding the privacy of the individuals behind the data. These concerns become even more important when health data are processed, as are considered sensitive (according to most global regulations). Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) attempt to protect the privacy of individuals whilst preserving the utility of data. One of the most popular technologies recently is Differential Privacy (DP), which was used for the 2020 U.S. Census. Another trend is to combine synthetic data generators with DP to create so-called private synthetic data generators. The objective is to preserve statistical properties as accurately as possible, while the generated data should be as different as possible compared to the original data regarding private features. While these technologies seem promising, there is a gap between academic research on DP and synthetic data and the practical application and evaluation of these techniques for real-world use cases. In this paper, we evaluate three different private synthetic data generators (MWEM, DP-CTGAN, and PATE-CTGAN) on their use-case-specific privacy and utility. For the use case, continuous heart rate measurements from different individuals are analyzed. This work shows that private synthetic data generators have tremendous advantages over traditional techniques, but also require in-depth analysis depending on the use case. Furthermore, it can be seen that each technology has different strengths, so there is no clear winner. However, DP-CTGAN often performs slightly better than the other technologies, so it can be recommended for a continuous medical data use case.

AB  - Clinical decision support systems are data analysis software that supports health professionals' decision - making the process to reach their ultimate outcome, taking into account patient information. However, the need for decision support systems cannot be denied because of most activities in the field of health care within the decision-making process. Decision support systems used for diagnosis are designed based on disease due to the complexity of diseases, symptoms, and disease-symptoms relationships. In the design and implementation of clinical decision support systems, mathematical modeling, pattern recognition and statistical analysis techniques of large databases and data mining techniques such as classification are also widely used. Classification of data is difficult in case of the small and / or imbalanced data set and this problem directly affects the classification performance. Small and/or imbalance dataset has become a major problem in data mining because classification algorithms are developed based on the assumption that the data sets are balanced and large enough. Most of the algorithms ignore or misclassify examples of the minority class, focus on the majority class. Most health data are small and imbalanced by nature. Learning from imbalanced and small data sets is an important and unsettled problem. Within the scope of the study, the publicly accessible data set, hepatitis was oversampled by distance-based data generation methods. The oversampled data sets were classified by using four different machine learning algorithms. Considering the classification scores of four different machine learning algorithms (Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes and Decision Tree), optimal synthetic data generation rate is recommended.

AB  - Diagnosis and prognosis processes are necessary to optimise the dependability of systems and ensure their safe operation. If there is a lack of information, faulty conditions cannot be identified and undesired events cannot be predicted. It is essential to predict such events and mitigate risks, but this is difficult in complex systems. Abnormal or unknown faults cause problems for maintenance decision-makers. We therefore propose a methodology that fuses data-driven and model-based approaches. Real data acquired from a real system and synthetic data generated from a physical model can be used together to perform diagnosis and prognosis.
   As systems have time-varying conditions related to both the operating conditions and the healthy or faulty state of the system, the idea behind the proposed methodology is to generate synthetic data in the whole range of conditions in which a system can work. Thus, data related to the context in which the system is operating can be generated. We also take a first step towards implementing this methodology in the field of rolling element bearings. Synthetic data are generated using a physical model that reproduces the dynamics of these machine elements. Condition indicators such as root mean square, kurtosis and shape factor, among others, are calculated from the vibrational response of a bearing and merged with the real features obtained from the data collected from the functioning system.
   Finally, the merged indicators are used to train support vector machine (SVM) classifiers so that a classification according to the condition of the bearing is made independently of the applied loading conditions, even though some of the scenarios have not yet occurred.

AB  - Dynamical information exchange between central and autonomic nervous systems, as referred to functional brain-heart interplay, occurs during emotional and physical arousal. It is well documented that physical and mental stress lead to sympathetic activation. Nevertheless, the role of autonomic inputs in nervous system-wise communication under mental stress is yet unknown. In this study, we estimated the causal and bidirectional neural modulations between electroencephalogram (EEG) oscillations and peripheral sympathetic and parasympathetic activities using a recently proposed computational framework for a functional brain-heart interplay assessment, namely the sympathovagal synthetic data generation model. Mental stress was elicited in 37 healthy volunteers by increasing their cognitive demands throughout three tasks associated with increased stress levels. Stress elicitation induced an increased variability in sympathovagal markers, as well as increased variability in the directional brain-heart interplay. The observed heart-to-brain interplay was primarily from sympathetic activity targeting a wide range of EEG oscillations, whereas variability in the efferent direction seemed mainly related to EEG oscillations in the c band. These findings extend current knowledge on stress physiology, which mainly referred to top-down neural dynamics. Our results suggest that mental stress may not cause an increase in sympathetic activity exclusively as it initiates a dynamic fluctuation within brain-body networks including bidirectional interactions at a brain-heart level. We conclude that directional brain-heart interplay measurements may provide suitable biomarkers for a quantitative stress assessment and bodily feedback may modulate the perceived stress caused by increased cognitive demand.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) is the most widespread and fastest growing technology today. Due to the increasing of IoT devices connected to the Internet, the IoT is the most technology under security attacks. The IoT devices are not designed with security because they are resource constrained devices. Therefore, having an accurate IoT security system to detect security attacks is challenging. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) using machine learning and deep learning techniques can detect security attacks accurately. This paper develops an IDS architecture based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning algorithms. We implement our model on the UNSW-NB15 dataset which is a new network intrusion dataset that categorizes the network traffic into normal and attacks traffic. In this work, interpolation data preprocessing is used to compute the missing values. Also, the imbalanced data problem is solved using a synthetic data generation method. Extensive experiments have been implemented to compare the performance results of the proposed model (CNN+LSTM) with a basic model (CNN only) using both balanced and imbalanced dataset. Also, with some state-of-the-art machine learning classifiers (Decision Tree (DT) and Random Forest (RF)) using both balanced and imbalanced dataset. The results proved the impact of the balancing technique. The proposed hybrid model with the balance technique can classify the traffic into normal class and attack class with reasonable accuracy (92.10%) compared with the basic CNN model (89.90%) and the machine learning (DT 88.57% and RF 90.85%) models. Moreover, comparing the proposed model results with the most related works shows that the proposed model gives good results compared with the related works that used the balance techniques.

AB  - Many internet platforms are two-sided markets that involve two types of participants. Examples include e-commerce platforms like Taobao (retailers and consumers) and ride-hailing platforms like Uber (drivers and passengers). Participants of different types in the two-sided market have relationships (i.e., supply and demand) that provide externalities and network benefits. On two-sided platforms, marketing campaigns are designed by subsidizing supply or demand. Uplift models built in this scenario usually consider the treatment assignment for only one of the two sides. However, ignoring the interaction of treatments between two sides or treating them as noises may result in incomplete models and inaccurate predictions. As far as we know, there is not much work related to modeling the combinational treatment effects in the two-sided market. In this paper, we first introduce the two-sided treatment effects estimation problem and then propose a Unified Treatment effect Estimation (UniTE) method for one-sided and two-sided marketing. We extend the Robinson Decomposition to two-sided, in which the relationship of the three involved tasks, namely the outcome, the propensity, and the treatment effect, is theoretically derived. Based on the decomposition result, a multi-task-based neural network model is proposed to integrate the three tasks and learn the inter-task-related common information, which prompts the model to estimate the treatment effects better. We also propose a unified synthetic data generation method that adapts to one/two-sided situations to verify the treatment effects estimation performance. Extensive and comprehensive experimental results show that our method outperforms the other methods.

AB  - Sewer pipes are essential infrastructure for discharging wastewater. Regular pipe inspection is necessary to prevent malfunction of sewer systems, for which closed-circuit television (CCTV) crawlers are commonly used to capture images of the pipe interior. As manual assessment of pipe condition is labor-intensive and timeconsuming, automated defect detection using computer vision and deep learning has been increasingly studied in recent years. However, deep learning approaches require large amount of annotated data for model training. Data collection in underground sewer pipes is expensive and difficult since they are inaccessible without the use of an inspection robot. Meanwhile, ground-truth annotation needs to be accurate and consistent, requiring massive time and expertise. This paper proposes a framework for synthetic data generation and augmentation to address the data shortage problem for sewer pipe defect detection. First, synthetic images of sewer pipes are generated by 3D modeling and simulation in virtual environment. The quality of the generated images is then enhanced using style transfer with reference to real inspection images. In addition, a contrastive learning module is developed to further improve the deep learning process for defect detection. Experiment results show that the average precision (AP) of the defect detection model is improved by 2.7% and 4.8% respectively after adding style-transferred synthetic images and applying the contrastive module. When both methods are applied, the AP of the model is boosted by 7.7%, from 22.22% to 23.92%, indicating the effectiveness of our proposed approaches. This study is expected to alleviate the burden on data collection and annotation for applying deep learning models in defect detection.

AB  - Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are equipped with several sensors which produce various forms of data, such as geo-location, distance, and camera data. The volume and utility of these data, especially camera data, have contributed to the advancement of high-performance self-driving applications. However, these vehicles and their collected data are prone to security and privacy attacks. One of the main attacks against AV-generated camera data is location inference, in which camera data is used to extract knowledge for tracking the users. A few research studies have proposed privacy-preserving approaches for analysing AV-generated camera data using powerful generative models, such as Variational Auto Encoder (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). However, the related work considers a weak geo-localisation attack model, which leads to weak privacy protection against stronger attack models. This paper proposes DeepClean, a robust deep-learning model that combines VAE and a private clustering technique. DeepClean learns distinct labelled object structures of the image data as clusters and generates a more visual representation of the non-private object clusters, e.g., roads. It then distorts the private object areas using a private Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to learn distinct cluster structures of the labelled object areas. The synthetic images generated from our model guarantee privacy and resist a robust location inference attack by less than 4% localisation accuracy. This result implies that using DeepClean for synthetic data generation makes it less likely for a subject to be localised by an attacker, even when using a robust geo-localisation attack. The overall image utility level of the generated synthetic images by DeepClean is comparable to the benchmark studies.

AB  - The medical and machine learning communities are relying on the promise of artificial intelligence (AI) to transform medicine through enabling more accurate decisions and personalized treatment. However, progress is slow. Legal and ethical issues around unconsented patient data and privacy is one of the limiting factors in data sharing, resulting in a significant barrier in accessing routinely collected electronic health records (EHR) by the machine learning community. We propose a novel framework for generating synthetic data that closely approximates the joint distribution of variables in an original EHR dataset, providing a readily accessible, legally and ethically appropriate solution to support more open data sharing, enabling the development of AI solutions. In order to address issues around lack of clarity in defining sufficient anonymization, we created a quantifiable, mathematical definition for "identifiability". We used a conditional generative adversarial networks (GAN) framework to generate synthetic data while minimize patient identifiability that is defined based on the probability of re-identification given the combination of all data on any individual patient. We compared models fitted to our synthetically generated data to those fitted to the real data across four independent datasets to evaluate similarity in model performance, while assessing the extent to which original observations can be identified from the synthetic data. Our model, ADS-GAN, consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods, and demonstrated reliability in the joint distributions. We propose that this method could be used to develop datasets that can be made publicly available while considerably lowering the risk of breaching patient confidentiality.

AB  - Privacy-preserving data publishing is an important problem that has been the focus of extensive study. The state-of-the-art solution for this problem is differential privacy, which offers a strong degree of privacy protection without making restrictive assumptions about the adversary. Existing techniques using differential privacy, however, cannot effectively handle the publication of high-dimensional data. In particular, when the input dataset contains a large number of attributes, existing methods require injecting a prohibitive amount of noise compared to the signal in the data, which renders the published data next to useless.
   To address the deficiency of the existing methods, this paper presents PrivBayes, a differentially private method for releasing high-dimensional data. Given a datasetD, PrivBayes first constructs a Bayesian network N, which (i) provides a succinct model of the correlations among the attributes in D and (ii) allows us to approximate the distribution of data in D using a set P of low-dimensional marginals of D. After that, PrivBayes injects noise into each marginal in P to ensure differential privacy and then uses the noisy marginals and the Bayesian network to construct an approximation of the data distribution in D. Finally, PrivBayes samples tuples fromthe approximate distribution to construct a synthetic dataset, and then releases the synthetic data. Intuitively, PrivBayes circumvents the curse of dimensionality, as it injects noise into the low-dimensional marginals in P instead of the high-dimensional dataset D. Private construction of Bayesian networks turns out to be significantly challenging, and we introduce a novel approach that uses a surrogate function for mutual information to build the model more accurately. We experimentally evaluate PrivBayes on real data and demonstrate that it significantly outperforms existing solutions in terms of accuracy.

AB  - Data scarcity is a significant problem in Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) adoption prediction, limiting the accuracy and reliability of traditional predictive models. This study addresses this issue by integrating Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, specifically Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), to generate synthetic data that supplements sparse real-world data. A systematic literature review identified critical gaps in existing ERP adoption models, underscoring the need for innovative approaches. The generated synthetic data, validated through comprehensive statistical analyses including mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis, and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, demonstrated high accuracy and reliability, aligning closely with real-world data. A hybrid predictive model was developed, combining Generative AI with Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) and Random Forest techniques. This model was rigorously tested and compared against traditional models such as SVM, Neural Networks, Linear Regression, and Decision Trees. The hybrid model achieved superior performance, with an accuracy of 90%, precision of 88%, recall of 89%, and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC) score of 0.91, significantly outperforming traditional models in predicting ERP adoption outcomes. The research also established continuous monitoring and adaptation mechanisms to ensure the model's long-term effectiveness. The findings provide practical insights for organizations, offering a robust tool for forecasting ERP adoption success and facilitating more informed decision-making and resource allocation. This study not only advances theoretical understanding by addressing data scarcity through synthetic data generation but also provides a practical framework for enhancing ERP adoption strategies.

AB  - Objective: The challenge of mixed-integer temporal data, which is particularly prominent for medication use in the critically ill, limits the performance of predictive models. The purpose of this evaluation was to pilot test integrating synthetic data within an existing dataset of complex medication data to improve machine learning model prediction of fluid overload.Materials and methods: This retrospective cohort study evaluated patients admitted to an ICU >= 72 h. Four machine learning algorithms to predict fluid overload after 48-72 h of ICU admission were developed using the original dataset. Then, two distinct synthetic data generation methodologies (synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) and conditional tabular generative adversarial network (CTGAN)) were used to create synthetic data. Finally, a stacking ensemble technique designed to train a meta-learner was established. Models underwent training in three scenarios of varying qualities and quantities of datasets.Results: Training machine learning algorithms on the combined synthetic and original dataset overall increased the performance of the predictive models compared to training on the original dataset. The highest performing model was the meta-model trained on the combined dataset with 0.83 AUROC while it managed to significantly enhance the sensitivity across different training scenarios. Discussion: The integration of synthetically generated data is the first time such methods have been applied to ICU medication data and offers a promising solution to enhance the performance of machine learning models for fluid overload, which may be translated to other ICU outcomes. A meta-learner was able to make a trade-off between different performance metrics and improve the ability to identify the minority class.

AB  - Many recently proposed structure-based virtual screening models appear to be able to accurately distinguish high affinity binders from non-binders. However, several recent studies have shown that they often do so by exploiting ligand-specific biases in the dataset, rather than identifying favourable intermolecular interactions in the input protein-ligand complex. In this work we propose a novel approach for assessing the extent to which machine learning-based virtual screening models are able to identify the functional groups responsible for binding. To sidestep the difficulty in establishing the ground truth importance of each atom of a large scale set of protein-ligand complexes, we propose a protocol for generating synthetic data. Each ligand in the dataset is surrounded by a randomly sampled point cloud of pharmacophores, and the label assigned to the synthetic protein-ligand complex is determined by a 3-dimensional deterministic binding rule. This allows us to precisely quantify the ground truth importance of each atom and compare it to the model generated attributions. Using our generated datasets, we demonstrate that a recently proposed deep learning-based virtual screening model, PointVS, identified the most important functional groups with 39% more efficiency than a fingerprint-based random forest, suggesting that it would generalise more effectively to new examples. In addition, we found that ligand-specific biases, such as those present in widely used virtual screening datasets, substantially impaired the ability of all ML models to identify the most important functional groups. We have made our synthetic data generation framework available to facilitate the benchmarking of new virtual screening models. Code is available at https://github.com/tomhadfield95/synthVS.

AB  - Imbalanced data classification is one of the major problems in machine learning. This imbalanced dataset typically has significant differ-ences in the number of data samples between its classes. In most cases, the per-formance of the machine learning algorithm such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) is affected when dealing with an imbalanced dataset. The classification accuracy is mostly skewed toward the majority class and poor results are exhibited in the prediction of minority-class samples. In this paper, a hybrid approach combining data pre-processing technique and SVM algorithm based on improved Simulated Annealing (SA) was proposed. Firstly, the data pre-processing technique which primarily aims at solving the resampling strategy of handling imbalanced datasets was proposed. In this technique, the data were first synthetically generated to equalize the number of samples between classes and followed by a reduction step to remove redundancy and duplicated data. Next is the training of a balanced dataset using SVM. Since this algorithm requires an iterative process to search for the best penalty parameter during training, an improved SA algorithm was proposed for this task. In this proposed improvement, a new acceptance criterion for the solution to be accepted in the SA algorithm was introduced to enhance the accuracy of the optimization process. Experimental works based on ten publicly available imbalanced datasets have demonstrated higher accuracy in the classification tasks using the proposed approach in comparison with the conventional implementation of SVM. Registering at an average of 89.65% of accuracy for the binary class classification has demonstrated the good performance of the proposed works.

AB  - Purpose: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has recently emerged as a source for powerful biomarkers in neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica (NMO). The application of machine learning techniques to the analysis of OCT data has enabled automatic extraction of information with potential to aid the timely diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases. These algorithms require large amounts of labeled data, but few such OCT data sets are available now.Methods: To address this challenge, here we propose a synthetic data generation method yielding a tailored augmentation of three-dimensional (3D) OCT data and preserving differences between control and disease data. A 3D active shape model is used to produce synthetic retinal layer boundaries, simulating data from healthy controls (HCs) as well as from patients with MS or NMO.Results: To evaluate the generated data, retinal thickness maps are extracted and evalu-ated under a broad range of quality metrics. The results show that the proposed model can generate realistic-appearing synthetic maps. Quantitatively, the image histograms of the synthetic thickness maps agree with the real thickness maps, and the cross -correlations between synthetic and real maps are also high. Finally, we use the gener-ated data as an augmentation technique to train stronger diagnostic models than those using only the real data.Conclusions: This approach provides valuable data augmentation, which can help overcome key bottlenecks of limited data. Translational Relevance: By addressing the challenge posed by limited data, the proposed method helps apply machine learning methods to diagnose neurodegenera-tive diseases from retinal imaging.

AB  - The ImageNet moment was a turning point for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), as it demonstrated their potential to revolutionize computer vision tasks. This triumph of CNNs has motivated solving even more complex problems involving multiple tasks from multiple data modalities. Conventionally, a single CNN accelerator has been optimized to perform just one task or multiple correlated tasks. This study presents a shared-layers approach that leverages the pattern-learning capabilities of CNNs to perform multiple uncorrelated tasks from different modalities using a single hardware accelerator. We overcame the challenge of data imbalance in multi-modal learning by synthetic data generation. We achieved an average classification accuracy above 90% on a single CNN accelerator, which would otherwise require three accelerators. Due to the reliability concerns imposed by transistor shrinking and aging, we extended the shared layers methodology and introduced a fault-tolerant CNN accelerator with reconfigurable capabilities supporting fault-tolerant (FT), high-performance (HP), and de-stress (DS) modes. FT mode provides high reliability against soft errors utilizing double/triple modular redundancy, HP mode offers peak performance of 0.979 TOPs using parallel execution, and DS mode reduces dynamic power consumption by up to 68.6% in clock-gated design and even more using a partial reconfiguration method, contributing to decelerating the aging process of the circuit. We have comprehensively evaluated two different CNN architectures (i.e., fused and branched), for three distinct tasks, in three different operating modes, based on accuracy, quantization, pruning, hardware resource utilization, power, energy, performance, and reliability.

AB  - Simulation is a powerful approach that plays a significant role in science and technology. Computational models that simulate learner interactions and data hold great promise for educational technology as well. Amongst others, simulated learners can be used for teacher training, for generating and evaluating hypotheses on human learning, for developing adaptive learning algorithms, for building virtual worlds in which students can practice collaboration skills with simulated pals, and for testing learning environments. This paper provides the first systematic literature review on simulated learners in the broad area of artificial intelligence in education and related fields, focusing on the decade 2010-19. We analyze the trends regarding the use of simulated learners in educational technology within this decade, the purposes for which simulated learners are being used, and how the validity of the simulated learners is assessed. We find that simulated learner models tend to represent only narrow aspects of student learning. And, surprisingly, we also find that almost half of the studies using simulated learners do not provide any evidence that their modeling addresses the most fundamental question in simulation design - is the model valid? This poses a threat to the reliability of results that are based on these models. Based on our findings, we propose that future research should focus on developing more complete simulated learner models. To validate these models, we suggest a standard and universal criterion, which is based on the lasting idea of Turing's Test. We discuss the properties of this test and its potential to move the field of simulated learners forward.

AB  - Rationale and Objectives: Histological variant (HV) of bladder urothelial carcinoma (UC) is a significant factor for therapy management. We aim to assess the predictive performance of machine learning (ML)-based Computed Tomography radiomics of UC for HV.Materials and Methods: Volume of interest of 37 bladder UC tumors, of which 21 were pure and 16 were HV, were manually segmented. The extracted first-and second-order texture features (n = 117) using 3-D Slicer radiomics were compared to the radical cystectomy his-topathological results. ML algorithms were performed to determine the significant models using Python 2.3, Pycaret library. The sample size was increased to 74 by synthetic data generation, and three outliers from the training set were removed (training dataset; n = 52, test dataset; n = 19). The predictive performances of 15 ML algorithms were compared. Then, the best two models were evaluated on the test set and ensembled by Voting Classifier.Results: The ML algorithms demonstrated area under curve (AUC) and accuracy ranging 0.79-0.97 and 50%-90%, respectively on the train set. The best models were Gradient Boosting Classifier (AUC: 0.95, accuracy: 90%) and CatBoost Classifier (AUC: 0.97, accuracy: 85%). On the test set; the Voting Classifier of these two models demonstrated AUC, accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 scores as follows; 0.93, 79%, 86%, 67%, and 75%, respectively.Conclusion: ML-based Computed Tomography radiomics of UC can predict HV, a prognostic factor that is indeterminable by qualitative radiological evaluation and can be missed in the preoperative histopathological specimens.

AB  - Real datasets often lack values, compromising the quality of data analyses. Adequate data may be synthetically imputed to replace missing values - a technique known as missing data imputation - avoiding deletion of incomplete observations. Several data imputation methods have been proposed and generative methods based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are successful alternatives to discriminative methods. In this extended version of our work presented at the International Conference on Computational Science Neves et al. (2021), we propose three novel data imputation methods based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN): SGAIN, WSGAIN-CP, and WSGAIN-GP.We further studied how data imputation methods can be used to generate fully synthetic datasets. Among other benefits, the generation of synthetic data can help to mitigate legal, ethical, and data privacy issues, as well as to augment original data. In this context, we introduce tabulator, which is a novel meta-method for synthetic data generation that uses the data imputation methods as back-end engines for tabular data generation.We evaluated our data imputation methods using datasets with different amputation rates following the Missing Completely At Random (MCAR) setting. The results show that our methods are en-par or outperform state-of-the-art imputation methods in terms of response time and the quality of imputed data. We further evaluated and compared our data generation methods, which were derived from tabulator, with a state-ofthe-art approach, the Conditional Tabular GAN (CTGAN). The evaluation results show that our tabulator methods outperform CTGAN in many cases, for example regarding the accuracy of machine learning tasks (e.g., prediction or classification) performed on the synthetic output data.

AB  - In an engine airpath system, modeling the nonlinearities associated with turbocharger vane position estimation is challenging as most influencing factors are not clearly known. State-of-the-art models are predominantly data driven, which makes the accuracy skewed toward the clusters with data richness. The data for these models are derived from the experiments in a dynamometer (dyno) or vehicle. The measurement data is extrapolated for the entire operating zone to derive the control models, which are inaccurate and slow in transient response. With emission norms becoming stringent, the models need to be more accurate with an improved transient response.
   The authors derive the synthetic data using "adaptive synthetic data generation" for the one engine operating zone. This improves the data richness of the dataset, which can be used for data-driven models, which is state of the art. The authors propose artificial intelligence (AI)-based model instead of data-driven models to improve the transient response of the system. The study shows that the use of AI models reduces the complexity of modeling and predicting turbine vane position without compromising the accuracy during transients and stability during steady states. The AI-based models are derived using supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. The most influencing parameters are extracted using feature extraction methods hybridized with expert decision-making. The AI-based model with an electromechanical time constant of the turbocharger was modeled using a "nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs" (NARX) and deep neural networks (DNN) methods. The comparative study with respect to the accuracy of both the models is done with "Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Cycle" (WLTC) and "Real Driving Emission" (RDE) tests.

AB  - In recent years, due to the extensive use of the Internet, the number of networked computers has been increasing in our daily lives. Weaknesses of the servers enable hackers to intrude on computers by using not only known but also new attack-types, which are more sophisticated and harder to detect. To protect the computers from them, Intrusion Detection System (IDS), which is trained with some machine learning techniques by using a pre-collected dataset, is one of the most preferred protection mechanisms. The used datasets were collected during a limited period in some specific networks and generally don & x2019;t contain up-to-date data. Additionally, they are imbalanced and cannot hold sufficient data for all types of attacks. These imbalanced and outdated datasets decrease the efficiency of current IDSs, especially for rarely encountered attack types. In this paper, we propose six machine-learning-based IDSs by using K Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Adaboost, Decision Tree, and Linear Discriminant Analysis algorithms. To implement a more realistic IDS, an up-to-date security dataset, CSE-CIC-IDS2018, is used instead of older and mostly worked datasets. The selected dataset is also imbalanced. Therefore, to increase the efficiency of the system depending on attack types and to decrease missed intrusions and false alarms, the imbalance ratio is reduced by using a synthetic data generation model called Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique (SMOTE). Data generation is performed for minor classes, and their numbers are increased to the average data size via this technique. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed approach considerably increases the detection rate for rarely encountered intrusions.

AB  - Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is one of the global health issues causing high mortality. Hence, timely and agile detection of such arrests and immediate defibrillation support to SCA victims is of the utmost importance. An automated external defibrillator (AED) is a medical device used to treat patients suffering from SCA by delivering an electric shock. An AED implements the machine learning (ML)- or deep learning (DL)-based approach to detect whether the patient needs an electric shock and then automates the shock if needed. However, the effectiveness of these models has relied on the availability of well-balanced data in class distribution. Due to privacy concerns, collecting sufficient data is more challenging in the medical domain. Generative adversarial networks (GAN) have been successfully used to create synthetic data and are far better than standard oversampling techniques in maintaining the original data's probability distribution. We, therefore, proposed a GAN-based DL approach, external classifier-Wasserstein conditional generative adversarial network (EC-WCGAN), to detect the shockable rhythms in an AED on an imbalanced ECG dataset. Our experiments demonstrate that the classifier trained with real and generated data via the EC-WCGAN significantly improves the performance metrics on the imbalanced dataset. Additionally, the WCGAN for generating synthetic data outperformed the standard oversampling technique, such as adaptive synthetic (ADASYN). In addition, our model achieved a high sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score (more than 99%) and a low balanced error rate (0.005) on the balanced 4-s segmented public Holter databases, meeting the American Health Association criteria for AEDs.

AB  - An important goal of translational bioinformatics is the construction of classifiers that can identify different sample classes from high-throughput measurements, such as RNA-seq. The genomic data sets are high-dimensional - with tens of thousands or more features, while the number of tested samples is often restricted to a few hundred or less, due to the high per sample cost or the rarity of phenotype. This means that the training and testing of the classifiers have to be performed on the same data set, where the standard deviation, variance, and lack of correlation with the true error can seriously impair error estimation. This problem underlines the importance of synthetic data generation models, resembling the behaviour of real gene expression to study the classification accuracy and to compare the performance of various classification rules. In this work we examine the influence of different model parameters for the generation of synthetic data, that resembles real RNA-seq data, on several classifiers (linear discriminant analysis (LDA), k-nearest neighbours (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural networks (ANN)). The estimation of the classification accuracy is assessed using the quantities related to the classification confusion matrix, and bolstered error estimation (BRESUB). BRESUB is particularly useful in the case of small number of available samples. Our comparative results show that SVM is the most accurate classifier in the majority of the considered simulated data scenarios. However, the simplest classification rule, LDA, has similar or in some cases even better accuracy when the number of training samples is small. This suggests that when only a small number of samples of real data is available LDA could be recommended as both simple and also accurate classification rule.

AB  - It is becoming more common for search and track algorithms to need to account for observations that can arise from both radio frequency (RF) and electro-optical infrared (EO/IR) measurements in the same scenario. Development of novel algorithms for search and track applications requires measured or synthetically generated data, and frequently only considers one or the other. Historically, the synthetic data generation process for RF and EO/IR developed independent of one another and did not share a common sense of "truth" about the environment or the objects within the simulation. This lack of a common framework with a consistent environment and platform representation between the two sensing modalities can lead to errors in the algorithm development process. For example, if the RF data assumed one set of atmospheric conditions while the EO/IR assumed a different set of conditions, the RF modality could over or under perform compared to the EO/IR. To address this issue, Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) has developed General High-fidelity Omni-Spectrum Toolbox (GHOST) as a plug and play simulation architecture to generate high-fidelity EO/IR and RF synthetic data for search and track algorithm development. Additionally, because GHOST is plug and play, it can potentially provide synthetic or measured result to developmental algorithms without needing to change the algorithm's interface. This paper presents the efforts GTRI has put into extending GHOST into the RF domain and presents sample results from search and track algorithm development. It also presents a look forward into how GHOST is being adapted to accommodate measured data alongside synthetic data for improved algorithm development.

AB  - New materials are frequently synthesized and optimized with the explicit intention to improve their properties to meet the ever-increasing societal requirements for high-performance and energy-efficient electronics, new battery concepts, better recyclability, and low-energy manufacturing processes. This often involves exploring vast combinations of stoichiometries and compositions, a process made more efficient by high-throughput robotic platforms. Nonetheless, subsequent analytical methods are essential to screen the numerous samples and identify promising material candidates. X-ray diffraction is a commonly used analysis method available in most laboratories which gives insight into the crystalline structure and reveals the presence of phases in a powder sample. Herein, a method for automating the analysis of XRD patterns, which uses a neural network model to classify samples into nondiffracting, single-phase, and multi-phase structures, is presented. To train neural networks for identifying materials with compositions not matching known crystallographic structures, a synthetic data generation approach is developed. The application of the neural networks on high-entropy oxides experimental data is demonstrated, where materials frequently deviate from anticipated structures. Our approach, not limited to these materials, seamlessly integrates into high-throughput data analysis pipelines, either filtering acquired patterns or serving as a standalone method for automated material exploration workflows.
   A neural network is used for automatic classification of X-ray diffraction scans and categorizes single-phase, multi-phase, and amorphous samples. The network is trained based on simulated patterns that are generated from a cif-file; no further modifications are necessary to use this system. Hence, this system can be used for rapid screening of vast composition spaces.image (c) 2023 WILEY-VCH GmbH

AB  - There is growing importance in the offshore floating production sector to develop reliable and robust means of continuously monitoring the integrity of mooring systems for FPSOs and FPUs, particularly in light of the upcoming introduction of API-RP-2MIM. Here, the limitations of the current range of monitoring techniques are discussed, including well established technologies such as load cells, sonar, or visual inspection, within the context of the growing mainstream acceptance of data science and machine learning. Due to the large fleet offloating production platforms currently in service, there is a need for a readily deployable solution that can be retrofitted to existing plaorms to passively monitor the performance of floating assets on their moorings, for which machine learning based systems have particular advantages. An earlier investigation conducted in 2016 on a shallow water, single point moored FPSO employed host facility data from in-service field measurements before and after a single mooring line failure event. This paper presents how the same machine learning techniques were applied to a deep water, semi taut, spread moored system where there was no host facility data available, therefore requiring a calibrated hydrodynamic numerical model to be used as the basis for the training data set. The machine learning techniques applied to both real and synthetically generated data were successful in replicating the response of the original system, even with the latter subjected to different variations of artificial noise. Furthermore, utilizing a probability-based approach, it was demonstrated that replicating the response of the underlying system was a powerful technique for predicting changes in the mooring system.

AB  - Objective: To investigate autonomic nervous system activity measured by brain-heart interactions in comatose patients after cardiac arrest in relation to the severity and prognosis of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury.Methods: Strength and complexity of bidirectional interactions between EEG frequency bands (delta, theta, and alpha) and ECG heart rate variability frequency bands (low frequency, LF and high frequency, HF) were computed using a synthetic data generation model. Primary outcome was the severity of brain injury, assessed by (i) standardized qualitative EEG classification, (ii) somatosensory evoked potentials (N20), and (iii) neuron-specific enolase levels. Secondary outcome was the 3-month neurological status, assessed by the Cerebral Performance Category score [good (1-2) vs. poor outcome (3-4-5)].Results: Between January 2007 and July 2021, 181 patients were admitted to ICU for a resuscitated cardiac arrest. Poor neurological outcome was observed in 134 patients (74%). Qualitative EEG patterns suggesting high severity were associated with decreased LF/HF. Severity of EEG changes were proportional to higher absolute values of brain-to-heart coupling strength (p < 0.02 for all brain-to-heart frequencies) and lower values of alpha-to-HF complexity (p = 0.049). Brain-to-heart coupling strength was significantly higher in patients with bilateral absent N20 and correlated with neuron-specific enolase levels at Day 3. This aberrant brain-to-heart coupling (increased strength and decreased complexity) was also associated with 3-month poor neurological outcome.Interpretation: Our results suggest that autonomic dysfunctions may well represent hypoxic-ischemic brain injury post cardiac arrest pathophysiology. These results open avenues for integrative monitoring of autonomic functioning in critical care patients.

AB  - According to a report published by Gartner in 2021, a significant portion of Machine Learning (ML) training data will be artificially generated. This development has led to the emergence of various synthetic data generators (SDGs), particularly those based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). All research endeavors so far have been exploratory, focused on specific objectives such as validating utility or disclosure control or assessing how generators can decrease or increase inherent bias with differential privacy. Hence, we aim to empirically identify an AI-based, data generator that can produce datasets that closely resemble real datasets, while also determining the hyper-parameters that enable a satisfactory balance between utility, privacy, and fairness in the datasets. To achieve this, we utilize the Synthetic Data Vault, Data Synthesizer, and Smartnoise-synth, which are three synthetic data generation packages that are accessible via Python. Different data generation models available within the package are presented with 13 tabular datasets iteratively as sample inputs to generate synthetic data. We generated synthetic data using every dataset and generator and investigated the goodness of the generator using five hypothetical scenarios. The utility and privacy offered by the generated data were compared with those of real data. The fairness in the ML model trained with synthetic data was used as a third metric for evaluation. Finally, we employ synthetic data to train regression and classification Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and evaluate their performance. After conducting experiments, analyzing metrics, and comparing ML scores across all 11 generators, we determined that the CTGAN from SDV and PATECTGAN from the SN-synth package were the most effective in mimicking real data for all 13 datasets utilized in our research.

AB  - In big data analysis, various zero-inflated problems are occurring. In particular, the problem of inflated zeros has a great influence on text big data analysis. In general, the preprocessed data from text documents are a matrix consisting of the documents and terms for row and column, respectively. Each element of this matrix is an occurred frequency of term in a document. Most elements of the matrix are zeros, because the number of columns is much larger than the rows. This problem is a cause of decreasing model performance in text data analysis. To overcome this problem, we propose a method of zero-inflated text data analysis using generative adversarial networks (GAN) and statistical modeling. In this paper, we solve the zero-inflated problem using synthetic data generated from the original data with zero inflation. The main finding of our study is how to change zero values to the very small numeric values with random noise through the GAN. The generator and discriminator of the GAN learned the zero-inflated text data together and built a model that generates synthetic data that can replace the zero-inflated data. We conducted experiments and showed the results, using real and simulation data sets to verify the improved performance of our proposed method. In our experiments, we used five quantitative measures, prediction sum of squares, R-squared, log-likelihood, Akaike information criterion and Bayesian information criterion to evaluate the model's performance between original and synthetic data sets. We found that all performances of our proposed method are better than the traditional methods.

CP  - 11th European Conference on Mobile Robots (ECMR)
AB  - Nowadays, there is a wide availability of datasets that enable the training of common object detectors or human detectors. These come in the form of labelled real-world images and require either a significant amount of human effort, with a high probability of errors such as missing labels, or very constrained scenarios, e.g. VICON systems. On the other hand, uncommon scenarios, like aerial views, animals, like wild zebras, or difficult-to-obtain information, such as human shapes, are hardly available. To overcome this, synthetic data generation with realistic rendering technologies has recently gained traction and advanced research areas such as target tracking and human pose estimation. However, subjects such as wild animals are still usually not well represented in such datasets. In this work, we first show that a pre-trained YOLO detector can not identify zebras in real images recorded from aerial viewpoints. To solve this, we present an approach for training an animal detector using only synthetic data. We start by generating a novel synthetic zebra dataset using GRADE, a state-of-the-art framework for data generation. The dataset includes RGB, depth, skeletal joint locations, pose, shape and instance segmentations for each subject. We use this to train a YOLO detector from scratch. Through extensive evaluations of our model with real-world data from i) limited datasets available on the internet and ii) a new one collected and manually labelled by us, we show that we can detect zebras by using only synthetic data during training. The code, results, trained models, and both the generated and training data are provided as open-source at https://eliabntt.github.io/grade-rr.

AB  - Longitudinal studies of infants' brains are essential for research and clinical detection of neurodevelopmental disorders. However, for infant brain MRI scans, effective deep learning-based segmentation frameworks exist only within small age intervals due to the large image intensity and contrast changes that take place in the early postnatal stages of development. However, using different segmentation frameworks or models at different age intervals within the same longitudinal data set would cause segmentation inconsistencies and age-specific biases. Thus, an age-agnostic segmentation model for infants' brains is needed. In this paper, we present "Infant-SynthSeg", an extension of the contrast-agnostic SynthSeg segmentation framework applicable to MRI data of infants at ages within the first year of life. Our work mainly focuses on extending learning strategies related to synthetic data generation and augmentation, with the aim of creating a method that employs training data capturing features unique to infants' brains during this early-stage development. Comparison across different learning strategy settings, as well as a more-traditional contrast-aware deep learning model (nnU-net) are presented. Our experiments show that our trained Infant-SynthSeg models show consistently high segmentation performance on MRI scans of infant brains throughout the first year of life. Furthermore, as the model is trained on ground truth labels at different ages, even labels that are not present at certain ages (such as cerebellar white matter at 1 month) can be appropriately segmented via Infant-SynthSeg across the whole age range. Finally, while Infant-SynthSeg shows consistent segmentation performance across the first year of life, it is outperformed by age-specific deep learning models trained for a specific narrow age range.

AB  - Quantization approximates a deep network model with floating-point numbers by the model with low bit width numbers, thereby accelerating inference and reducing computation. Zero-shot quantization, which aims to quantize a model without access to the original data, can be achieved by fitting the real data distribution through data synthesis. However, it has been observed that zero-shot quantization leads to inferior performance compared to post-training quantization with real data for two primary reasons: 1) a normal generator has difficulty obtaining a high diversity of synthetic data since it lacks long-range information to allocate attention to global features, and 2) synthetic images aim to simulate the statistics of real data, which leads to weak intra-class heterogeneity and limited feature richness. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel deep network quantizer called long-range zero-shot generative deep network quantization (LRQ). Technically, we propose a long-range generator (LRG) to learn long-range information instead of simple local features. To incorporate more global features into the synthetic data, we use long-range attention with large-kernel convolution in the generator. In addition, we also present an adversarial margin add (AMA) module to force intra-class angular enlargement between the feature vector and class center. The AMA module forms an adversarial process that increases the convergence difficulty of the loss function, which is opposite to the training objective of the original loss function. Furthermore, to transfer knowledge from the full-precision network, we also utilize decoupled knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LRQ obtains better performance than other competitors.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - For the multilingual interoperation in cross-country industrial systems, character recognition is a research issue that can largely facilitate the automatic information integration of an enormous number of forms, but has not been well resolved. Character recognition using the deep convolutional neural network depends on large scale training data collection and labor-intensive labeling work to train an effective model. Synthetic data generation and data augmentation are the typical means to compensate for the scarcity of labeled training data. However, the domain shift between synthetic data and real data inevitably results in unsatisfying recognition accuracy, bringing a significant challenge. To alleviate such an issue, a recognition system with enhanced two-phase transfer learning is proposed to utilize unlabeled real data in existing industrial forms. In the framework, massive training data are generated automatically with a configurable font and character library. A proposed convolutional neural network suitable for character recognition is pre-trained with the generated training data as the source model. In the first transfer phase, the source model is adapted to the target model with real samples of a specific writing style in an unsupervised manner. In the second supervised transfer phase, the target model is further optimized with a few labels available. The recognition application is described based on the target model. The effectiveness of the proposed enhanced two-phase model transfer method is validated on the public dataset as the target domain data through systematic experiments. Furthermore, a comparison with related works is provided to show the transferability and efficiency of the proposed framework.

AB  - Social networks have long been the subject of scientific researches, frequently hindered by the unavailability of representative datasets. The advent of online social networks (OSNs), which store data about interactions between billions of people, has greatly alleviated this problem. Since user interaction on the OSNs can correspond to their real-life relationships, OSN datasets quickly became a highly sought-after resource for social network research. However, enabling open access to such data entails serious security and privacy risks, especially after the introduction of the European General Data Protection Regulation. Some researchers mitigate this problem through anonymization, while others argue for the creation of synthetic datasets. We consider synthetic datasets preferable since they circumvent the security and privacy issues. Existing synthetic dataset generators produce a social graph containing only information whether a pair of nodes are connected. However, interpersonal relationships are much more complex. Because of that, our research considers the possibility of generating a synthetic expanded social graph which, in addition to the information about the existence of a connection between a pair of users, also provides information about the types and intensities of users' interactions. As Facebook is the leading OSN today, we performed an extensive analysis of Facebook users' interaction records with the aim of getting an insight into real-life interaction patterns. In this paper, we present results of this analysis at ego-user level and offer the conceptual solution for synthetic expanded social graph generation, which uses conducted analysis results as its basis.

AB  - Very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) provides the highest-resolution images in astronomy. The sharpest resolution is nominally achieved at the highest frequencies, but as the observing frequency increases, so too does the atmospheric contribution to the system noise, degrading the sensitivity of the array and hampering detection. In this paper, we explore the limits of high-frequency VLBI observations using ngehtsim, a new tool for generating realistic synthetic data. ngehtsim uses detailed historical atmospheric models to simulate observing conditions, and it employs heuristic visibility detection criteria that emulate single- and multifrequency VLBI calibration strategies. We demonstrate the fidelity of ngehtsim's predictions using a comparison with existing 230 GHz data taken by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), and we simulate the expected performance of EHT observations at 345 GHz. Though the EHT achieves a nearly 100% detection rate at 230 GHz, our simulations indicate that it should expect substantially poorer performance at 345 GHz; in particular, observations of M87* at 345 GHz are predicted to achieve detection rates of less than or similar to 20% that may preclude imaging. Increasing the array sensitivity through wider bandwidths and/or longer integration times-as enabled through, e.g., the simultaneous multifrequency upgrades envisioned for the next-generation EHT-can improve the 345 GHz prospects and yield detection levels that are comparable to those at 230 GHz. M87* and Sgr A* observations carried out in the atmospheric window around 460 GHz could expect to regularly achieve multiple detections on long baselines, but analogous observations at 690 and 875 GHz consistently obtain almost no detections at all.

AB  - In recent years, mixed reality (MR) technology has gained popularity in construction management due to its real-time visualisation capability to facilitate on-site decision-making tasks. The semantic segmentation of building components provides an attractive solution towards digital construction monitoring, reducing workloads through automation techniques. Nevertheless, data shortages remain an issue in maximizing the performance potential of deep learning segmentation methods. The primary aim of this study is to address this issue through synthetic data generation using Building Information Modelling (BIM) models. This study presents a point-cloud-based deep learning segmentation approach to a 3D light steel framing (LSF) system through synthetic BIM models and as-built data captured using MR headsets. A standardisation workflow between BIM and MR models was introduced to enable seamless data exchange across both domains. A total of five different experiments were set up to identify the benefits of synthetic BIM data in supplementing actual as-built data for model training. The results showed that the average testing accuracy using solely as-built data stood at 82.88%. Meanwhile, the introduction of synthetic BIM data into the training dataset led to an improved testing accuracy of 86.15%. A hybrid dataset also enabled the model to segment both the BIM and as-built data captured using an MR headset at an average accuracy of 79.55%. These findings indicate that synthetic BIM data have the potential to supplement actual data, reducing the costs associated with data acquisition. In addition, this study demonstrates that deep learning has the potential to automate construction monitoring tasks, aiding in the digitization of the construction industry.

AB  - When a sufficient amount of training data is available, Machine Learning (ML) models show great promise for solving problems involving complex and dynamic patterns. Social and behavioral domains are rich with such challenging problems, with complex object data extracted from documents, surveys, etc., and represented in forms such as graphs and trees. However, many social and behavioral data sets are inherently sparse and incomplete. The same data field may be unavailable in different records of a data set due to different causes, e.g., because it was not measured, not known, or simply not applicable to that particular record. Furthermore, collection challenges, cost, lack of participation, small affected populations, etc., result in very small sets of data. Resulting unconventional datasets cannot be directly used with potent approaches such as machine learning. A technique to model and synthesize large sets of such complex data objects while maintaining the same statistical and topological characteristics of original data helps overcome these challenges. We propose a novel feature mapping technique to eliminate data inconsistencies and model data objects from unconventional datasets. The feature-mapped data objects are used to synthesize data using two likelihood approaches, i.e., multi-variate Gaussian and regular vine copulas, and one generative adversarial approach using an adversarial autoencoder (AAE). We demonstrate the robustness of the proposed technique with three real-world datasets representing disparate domains and validate the performance of likelihood and deep-generative approaches with these object synthesis strategies.

AB  - Objective Rectal toxicity is one of the primary dose-limiting side effects of prostate cancer radiotherapy, and consequential impairment on quality of life in these patients with long survival is an important problem. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the possibility of predicting rectal toxicity with artificial intelligence model which was including certain dosimetric parameters.Materials and methods One hundred and thirty-seven patients with a diagnosis of prostate cancer who received curative radiotherapy for prostate +/- pelvic lymphatics were included in the study. The association of the clinical data and dosimetric data between early and late rectal toxicity reported during follow-up was evaluated. The sample size was increased to 274 patients by synthetic data generation method. To determine suitable models, 15 models were studied with machine learning algorithms using Python 2.3, Pycaret library. Random forest classifier was used with to detect active variables.Results The area under the curve and accuracy were found to be 0.89-0.97 and 95%-99%, respectively, with machine learning algorithms. The sensitivity values for acute and toxicity were found to be 0.95 and 0.99, respectively.Conclusion Early or late rectal toxicity can be predicted with a high probability via dosimetric and physical data and machine learning algorithms of patients who underwent prostate +/- pelvic radiotherapy. The fact that rectal toxicity can be predicted before treatment, which may result in limiting the dose and duration of treatment, makes us think that artificial intelligence can enter our daily practice in a short time in this sense.

AB  - Most existing data-driven power system short-term voltage stability assessment (STVSA) approaches presume class-balanced input data. However, in practical applications, the occurrence of short-term voltage instability following a disturbance is minimal, leading to a significant class imbalance problem and a consequent decline in classifier performance. This work proposes a Transformer-based STVSA method to address this challenge. By utilizing the basic Transformer architecture, a stability assessment Transformer (StaaT) is developed as a classification model to reflect the correlation between the operational states of the system and the resulting stability outcomes. To combat the negative impact of imbalanced datasets, this work employs a conditional Wasserstein generative adversarial network with gradient penalty (CWGAN-GP) for synthetic data generation, aiding in the creation of a balanced, representative training set for the classifier. Semi-supervised clustering learning is implemented to enhance clustering quality, addressing the lack of a unified quantitative criterion for short-term voltage stability. Numerical tests on the IEEE 39-bus test system extensively demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits robust performance under class imbalances up to 100:1 and noisy environments, and maintains consistent effectiveness even with an increased penetration of renewable energy. Comparative results reveal that the CWGAN-GP generates more balanced datasets than traditional oversampling methods and that the StaaT outperforms other deep learning algorithms. This study presents a compelling solution for real-world STVSA applications that often face class imbalance and data noise challenges.

AB  - Due to the advancements in 5 G technologies, high-definition, and the internet of things (IoT), the capacity demand of optical networks has been exponentially increased. Optical communication networks offer several metrics such as high transmission capacity, low transmission loss, better anti-interference, robustness, etc which offers new opportunities to the communication field. To satisfy the increasing demands of optical networks, effective network resource utilization become essential. So, it is needed to design proper planning tools with superior accuracy for quality of transmission (QoT) in optical networks. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques pose new opportunities for resolving these issues and machine learning (ML) algorithms offer better performance over the analytical approaches. With this motivation, this paper presents a novel AI based cognitive QoT prediction (AI-CQoT) model for optical communication networks. The proposed AI-CQoT model aims to predict the QoT for the quality of service (QoS) link setup using AI techniques with the transmission equation based synthetic data generation. The proposed model uses the Label weighting extreme learning machine (LW-ELM) model for the prediction process which includes a link and signal characteristics as input features. Besides, the LW-ELM model is trained by the use of transmission equations. For improving the predictive performance of the LW-ELM model, the parameters such as weight matrix W and penalty factor C are optimally tuned by the use of the shuffled shepherd optimization (SSO) algorithm. A detailed experimental validation is performed to highlight the improved performance of the AI-CQoT model and the results are investigated in terms of different performance measures.

AB  - Surgical data science is devoted to enhancing the quality, safety, and efficacy of interventional healthcare. While the use of powerful machine learning algorithms is becoming the standard approach for surgical data science, the underlying end-to-end task models directly infer high-level concepts (e.g., surgical phase or skill) from low-level observations (e.g., endoscopic video). This end-to-end nature of contemporary approaches makes the models vulnerable to non-causal relationships in the data and requires the re-development of all components if new surgical data science tasks are to be solved. The digital twin (DT) paradigm, an approach to building and maintaining computational representations of real-world scenarios, offers a framework for separating low-level processing from high-level inference. In surgical data science, the DT paradigm would allow for the development of generalist surgical data science approaches on top of the universal DT representation, deferring DT model building to low-level computer vision algorithms. In this latter effort of DT model creation, geometric scene understanding plays a central role in building and updating the digital model. In this work, we visit existing geometric representations, geometric scene understanding tasks, and successful applications for building primitive DT frameworks. Although the development of advanced methods is still hindered in surgical data science by the lack of annotations, the complexity and limited observability of the scene, emerging works on synthetic data generation, sim-to-real generalization, and foundation models offer new directions for overcoming these challenges and advancing the DT paradigm.

AB  - The ever-increasing use of generative models in various fields where tabular data is used highlights the need for robust and standardized validation metrics to assess the similarity between real and synthetic data. Current methods lack a unified framework and rely on diverse and often inconclusive statistical measures. Divergences, which quantify discrepancies between data distributions, offer a promising avenue for validation. However, traditional approaches calculate divergences independently for each feature due to the complexity of joint distribution modeling. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a novel approach that uses divergence estimation to overcome the limitations of marginal comparisons. Our core contribution lies in applying a divergence estimator to build a validation metric considering the joint distribution of real and synthetic data. We leverage a probabilistic classifier to approximate the density ratio between datasets, allowing the capture of complex relations. We specifically calculate two divergences: the well-known Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and the Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence. KL divergence offers an established use in the field, while JS divergence is symmetric and bounded, providing a reliable metric. The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated through a series of experiments with varying distribution complexities. The initial phase involves comparing estimated divergences with analytical solutions for simple distributions, setting a benchmark for accuracy. Finally, we validate our method on a real-world dataset and its corresponding synthetic counterpart, showcasing its effectiveness in practical applications. This research offers a significant contribution with applicability beyond tabular data and the potential to improve synthetic data validation in various fields.

AB  - Astrophysical black holes are expected to be described by the Kerr metric. This is the only stationary, vacuum, axisymmetric metric, without electromagnetic charge, that satisfies Einstein's equations and does not have pathologies outside of the event horizon. We present new constraints on potential deviations from the Kerr prediction based on 2017 EHT observations of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*). We calibrate the relationship between the geometrically defined black hole shadow and the observed size of the ring-like images using a library that includes both Kerr and non-Kerr simulations. We use the exquisite prior constraints on the mass-to-distance ratio for Sgr A* to show that the observed image size is within similar to 10% of the Kerr predictions. We use these bounds to constrain metrics that are parametrically different from Kerr, as well as the charges of several known spacetimes. To consider alternatives to the presence of an event horizon, we explore the possibility that Sgr A* is a compact object with a surface that either absorbs and thermally reemits incident radiation or partially reflects it. Using the observed image size and the broadband spectrum of Sgr A*, we conclude that a thermal surface can be ruled out and a fully reflective one is unlikely. We compare our results to the broader landscape of gravitational tests. Together with the bounds found for stellar-mass black holes and the M87 black hole, our observations provide further support that the external spacetimes of all black holes are described by the Kerr metric, independent of their mass.

AB  - Background: The choice of EEG reference has been widely studied. However, the choice of the most appropriate re-referencing for EEG data is still debated. Moreover, the role of EEG reference in the estimation of functional Brain-Heart Interplay (BHI), together with different multivariate modelling strategies, has not been investigated yet. Methods: This study identifies the best methodology combining a proper EEG electrical reference and signal processing methods for an effective functional BHI assessment. The effects of the EEG reference among common average, mastoids average, Laplacian reference, Cz reference, and the reference electrode standardization technique (REST) were explored throughout different BHI methods including synthetic data generation (SDG) model, heartbeat-evoked potentials, heartbeat-evoked oscillations, and maximal information coefficient. Results: The SDG model exhibited high robustness between EEG references, whereas the maximal information coefficient method exhibited a high sensitivity. The common average and REST references for EEG showed a good consistency in the between-method comparisons. Laplacian, and Cz references significantly bias a BHI measurement. Comparison with existing methods: The use of EEG reference based on a common average outperforms on the use of other references for consistency in estimating directed functional BHI. We do not recommend the use of EEG references based on analytical derivations as the experimental conditions may not meet the requirements of their optimal estimation, particularly in clinical settings. Conclusion: The use of a common average for EEG electrical reference is concluded to be the most appropriate choice for a quantitative, functional BHI assessment.

AB  - Benefiting extensively from the Internet of Things (IoT) and sensor network technologies, the modern smart building achieves thermal comfort. It prevents energy wastage by performing automatic Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) to maintain the good condition of its air-conditioning systems. Often, real-time multi-sensor measurements are collected, and supervised learning algorithms are adopted to exploit the data for an effective FDD. A key issue with the supervised methods is their dependence on well-labeled fault data, which is difficult to obtain in many real-world scenarios despite the abundance of unlabelled sensor data. Intuitively, the problem can be greatly alleviated if some well-labeled fault data collected under a particular setting can be re-used and transferred to other cases where labeled fault data is challenging or costly. Bearing this idea, we proposed a novel Adversarial Cross domain Data Generation (ACDG) framework to impute missing fault data for building fault detection and diagnosis where labeled data is costly. Unlike traditional Transfer Learning (TL)-related applications that adapt models or features learned in the source domain to the target domain, ACDG essentially "generates" the unknown sensor data for the target setting (target domain). This is accomplished by capturing the data patterns and common knowledge from known counterparts in the other setting (source domain), the inter-domain knowledge, and the intra-domain relations. The proposed ACDG framework is tested with the real-world Air Handling Unit (AHU) fault dataset of the ASHRAE Research Project 1312. Extensive experimental results on the cross-domain AHU fault data showed the effectiveness of ACDG in supplementing the data for a missing fault category by exploiting the underlying commonalities between different domain settings.

AB  - Missing labels in multi-label datasets are a common problem, especially for minority classes, which are more likely to occur. This limitation hinders the performance of classifiers in identifying and extracting information from minority classes. Oversampling is an effective method for addressing imbalanced multi-label problems by generating synthetic instances to create a class-balanced dataset. However, the existing oversampling algorithms mainly focus on the location of the generated data, and there is a lack of design on how to complete the labels of the synthetic data. To address this issue, we propose MLAWSMOTE, a synthetic data generation algorithm based on matrix factorization weights. We introduce a weak supervised learning method in the oversampling method, optimize the weights of features and labels by using label correlation, and iteratively learn the ideal label weights. The mapping relationship between features and labels is learned from the dataset and the label correlation matrix. The oversampling ratio is defined based on the discrepancy between observed labels and the ideal label of synthetic instances. It mitigates the impact of missing minority labels on the model's predictions. The labeling of synthetic instances is performed based on label prediction, and the potential labeling distribution is complemented. Experimental results on multiple multi-label datasets under different label missing ratios demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of ACC, Hamming loss, MacroF1 and MicroF1. In the validation of the four classifiers, MacroF1 decreased by 24.78%, 17.81%, 3.8% and 19.56%, respectively, with the increase of label loss rate. After applying MLAWSMOTE only decreased by 15.79%, 13.63%, 3.78% and 15.21%.

AB  - Detection of volatile organic compounds in exhaled air is a promising approach to non-invasive and scalable gastric cancer screening. This work proposes a new approach for the detection of volatile organic compounds by analyzing odor-evoked calcium responses in the rat olfactory bulb. We estimate the feasibility of gastric cancer biomarker detection added to the exhaled air of healthy participants. Our detector consists of a convolutional encoder and a similarity-based classifier over encoder outputs. To minimize overfitting on a small available training set, we involve a pre-training where the encoder is trained on synthetic data representing spatiotemporal patterns similar to real calcium responses in the olfactory bulb. We estimate the classification accuracy of exhaled air samples by matching their encodings with encodings of calibration samples of two classes: 1) exhaled air and 2) a mixture of exhaled air with the cancer biomarker. On our data, the accuracy increased from 0.68 on real data up to 0.74 if pre-training on synthetic data is involved. Our work is focused on proving the feasibility of proposed new approach rather than on comparing its efficiency with existing methods. Such detection is often performed with an electronic nose, but its output becomes unstable over time due to a sensor drift. In contrast to the electronic nose, rats can robustly detect low concentrations of biomarkers over lifetime. The feasibility of gastric cancer biomarker detection in exhaled air by bio-hybrid system is shown. Pretraining of neural models for images analysis increases the accuracy of detection.

AB  - Due to the recent development in the deep learning community and the availability of state-of-the-art models, medical practitioners are getting more interested in computer vision and deep learning for diagnosis tasks. Moreover, those medical diagnostic models can also increase the reliability of conventional findings. As radiology images can convey a lot of information for a patient's diagnosis task, the problem is that such medical data may contain sensitive private information in their content header. De-anonymization (i.e., removal of sensitive header information) does not work well due to the re-identification risk, which may link those images to essential details (e.g., birth date, SSN, institution name, etc.), and such an approach can also reduce utility. In the medical domain, utility is significant because a less accurate diagnosis may lead to the wrong course of treatment and/or loss of life. In this paper, we developed a differentially private approach that can generate high-quality and high dimensional synthetic medical image data with guaranteed differential privacy. It can be used to create sufficient quality data to train a deep model. Moreover, we used W-GAN for bounded gradient guarantee, which eliminates the need for an extensive clipping hyperparameter search. We also added noise selectively to the generator to maintain the privacy-utility trade-off. Due to a noise-free discriminator and such selective noise addition to the generator, high-quality and reliable generated radiology images can be utilized for diagnosis tasks. Moreover, our approach can work in a distributed system where different hospitals can contain their private images in the local server and use a central server to generate synthetic radiology images without storing patient data.

AB  - In recent years, computer vision algorithms have shown to effectively leverage visual data from jobsites for video-based activity analysis of construction equipment. However, earthmoving operations are restricted to site work and surrounding terrain, and the presence of other structures, particularly in urban areas, limits the number of viewpoints from which operations can be recorded. These considerations lower the degree of intra-activity and interactivity category variability to which said algorithms are exposed, hindering their potential for generalizing effectively to new jobsites. Secondly, training computer vision algorithms is also typically reliant on large quantities of hand-annotated ground truth. These annotations are burdensome to obtain and can offset the cost-effectiveness incurred from automating activity analysis. The main contribution of this paper is a means of inexpensively generating synthetic data to improve the capabilities of vision-based activity analysis methods based on virtual, kinematically articulated three-dimensional (3D) models of construction equipment. The authors introduce an automated synthetic data generation method that outputs a two-dimensional (2D) pose corresponding to simulated excavator operations that vary according to camera position with respect to the excavator and activity length and behavior. The presented method is validated by training a deep learning-based method on the synthesized 2D pose sequences and testing on pose sequences corresponding to real-world excavator operations, achieving 75% precision and 71% recall. This exceeds the 66% precision and 65% recall obtained when training and testing the deep learning-based method on the real-world data via cross-validation. Limited access to reliable amounts of real-world data incentivizes using synthetically generated data for training vision-based activity analysis algorithms.

AB  - Privacy-preserving data publishing is an important problem that has been the focus of extensive study. The state-of-the-art goal for this problem is differential privacy, which offers a strong degree of privacy protection without making restrictive assumptions about the adversary. Existing techniques using differential privacy, however, cannot effectively handle the publication of high-dimensional data. In particular, when the input dataset contains a large number of attributes, existing methods require injecting a prohibitive amount of noise compared to the signal in the data, which renders the published data next to useless.
   To address the deficiency of the existing methods, this paper presents PRIVBAYES, a differentially private method for releasing high-dimensional data. Given a dataset D, PRIVBAYES first constructs a Bayesian network N, which (i) provides a succinct model of the correlations among the attributes in D and (ii) allows us to approximate the distribution of data in D using a set P of low-dimensional marginals of D. After that, PRIVBAYES injects noise into each marginal in P to ensure differential privacy, and then uses the noisy marginals and the Bayesian network to construct an approximation of the data distribution in D. Finally, PRIVBAYES samples tuples from the approximate distribution to construct a synthetic dataset, and then releases the synthetic data. Intuitively, PRIVBAYES circumvents the curse of dimensionality, as it injects noise into the low-dimensional marginals in P instead of the high-dimensional dataset D. Private construction of Bayesian networks turns out to be significantly challenging, and we introduce a novel approach that uses a surrogate function for mutual information to build the model more accurately. We experimentally evaluate PRIVBAYES on real data, and demonstrate that it significantly outperforms existing solutions in terms of accuracy.

AB  - This paper investigates whether particle ensembles in a fractured rock domain may be adequately modeled as an operator-stable plume. If this statistical model applies to transport in fractured media, then an ensemble plume in a fractured rock domain may be modeled using the novel Fokker-Planck evolution equation of the operator-stable plume. These plumes (which include the classical multi-Gaussian as a subset) are typically characterized by power law leading-edge concentration profiles and super-Fickian growth rates. To investigate the possible correspondence of ensemble plumes to operator-stable densities, we use numerical simulations of fluid flow and solute transport through large-scale (2.5 km by 2.5 km), randomly generated fracture networks. These two-dimensional networks are generated according to fracture statistics obtained from field studies that describe fracture length, transmissivity, density, and orientation. A fracture continuum approach using MODFLOW is developed for the solution of fluid flow within the fracture network and low-permeability rock matrix, while a particle-tracking code, random walk particle method for simulating transport in heterogeneous permeable media (RWHet), is used to simulate the advective motion of conservative solutes through the model domain. By deterministically mapping individual fractures onto a highly discretized finite difference grid (1 m x 1 m x 1 m here), the MODFLOW "continuum'' simulations can faithfully preserve details of the generated network and can approximate fluid flow in a discrete fracture network model. An advantage of the MODFLOW approach is that matrix permeability can be made nonzero to account for any degree of matrix flow and/or transport.

AB  - In settings requiring synthetic data generation based on a clinical cohort, e.g., due to data protection regulations, heterogeneity across individuals might be a nuisance that we need to control or faithfully preserve. The sources of such heterogeneity might be known, e.g., as indicated by sub-groups labels, or might be unknown and thus reflected only in properties of distributions, such as bimodality or skewness. We investigate how such heterogeneity can be preserved and controlled when obtaining synthetic data from variational autoencoders (VAEs), i.e., a generative deep learning technique that utilizes a low-dimensional latent representation. To faithfully reproduce unknown heterogeneity reflected in marginal distributions, we propose to combine VAEs with pre-transformations. For dealing with known heterogeneity due to sub-groups, we complement VAEs with models for group membership, specifically from propensity score regression. The evaluation is performed with a realistic simulation design that features sub-groups and challenging marginal distributions. The proposed approach faithfully recovers the latter, compared to synthetic data approaches that focus purely on marginal distributions. Propensity scores add complementary information, e.g., when visualized in the latent space, and enable sampling of synthetic data with or without sub-group specific characteristics. We also illustrate the proposed approach with real data from an international stroke trial that exhibits considerable distribution differences between study sites, in addition to bimodality. These results indicate that describing heterogeneity by statistical approaches, such as propensity score regression, might be more generally useful for complementing generative deep learning for obtaining synthetic data that faithfully reflects structure from clinical cohorts.

AB  - BackgroundSkin diseases are severe diseases. Identification of these severe diseases depends upon the abstraction of atypical skin regions. The segmentation of these skin diseases is essential to rheumatologists in risk impost and for valuable and vital decision-making. Skin lesion segmentation from images is a crucial step toward achieving this goal-timely exposure of malignancy in psoriasis expressively intensifies the persistence ratio. Defies occur when people presume skin diseases they have without accurately and precisely incepted. However, analyzing malignancy at runtime is a big challenge due to the truncated distinction of the visual similarity between malignance and non-malignance lesions. However, images' different shapes, contrast, and vibrations make skin lesion segmentation challenging. Recently, various researchers have explored the applicability of deep learning models to skin lesion segmentation.Materials and methodsThis paper introduces a skin lesions segmentation model that integrates two intelligent methodologies: Bayesian inference and edge intelligence. In the segmentation model, we deal with edge intelligence to utilize the texture features for the segmentation of skin lesions. In contrast, Bayesian inference enhances skin lesion segmentation's accuracy and efficiency.ResultsWe analyze our work along several dimensions, including input data (datasets, preprocessing, and synthetic data generation), model design (architecture, modules), and evaluation aspects (data annotation requirements and segmentation performance). We discuss these dimensions from seminal works and a systematic viewpoint and examine how these dimensions have influenced current trends.ConclusionWe summarize our work with previously used techniques in a comprehensive table to facilitate comparisons. Our experimental results show that Bayesian-Edge networks can boost the diagnostic performance of skin lesions by up to 87.80% without incurring additional parameters of heavy computation.

AB  - The financial industry is currently experiencing a substantial shift in its operating landscape because of the swift integration of technology. This transformation brings with it potential risks and challenges. Heightened occurrence of online fraud is one the key concerns for this sector, which has been exacerbated by the growing prevalence of online payment methods on e-commerce platforms and other websites. The identification of credit card fraud is a challenging task due to nature of imbalanced transactional data to detect and predict any fraudulent activities. In this context, this paper provides a unique approach to create synthetic dataset to tackle imbalanced issue for credit card fraud detection. The approach adopts Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) technique for balancing dataset. An experiment is performed using several ML models including SVM (Support Vector Machines), KNN (K-Nearest Neighbours), and Random Forest to demonstrate the feasibility of using synthetic data. In this study, we have combined resampling techniques like SMOTE for oversampling the minority class with ensemble methods and appropriate evaluation metrics like the F1-score to improve the imbalanced data. The result from the experiment compared with widely used public datasets to evaluate the model performance. The analysis reveals an imbalance in the real ULB (Universite Libre de Bruxelles) dataset, with the positive class (frauds) comprising a mere 0.172% of all transactions. The findings clearly show that the Random Forest model performs better than other modes with outstanding precision, recall, accuracy, and F1 score values to detect fraudulent transactions and reduce false positives.

AB  - In recent years, there has been a surge in the development of models for the generation of synthetic mobility data. These models aim to facilitate the sharing of data while safeguarding privacy, all while ensuring high utility and flexibility regarding potential applications. However, current utility evaluation methods fail to fully account for real-life requirements.
   We evaluate the utility of five state-of-the-art synthesis approaches, each with and without the incorporation of differential privacy (DP) guarantees, in terms of real-world applicability. Specifically, we focus on so-called trip data that encode fine granular urban movements such as GPS-tracked taxi rides. Such data prove particularly valuable for downstream tasks at the road network level. Thus, our initial step involves appropriately map matching the synthetic data and subsequently comparing the resulting trips with those generated by the routing algorithm implemented in OpenStreetMap, which serves as an efficient and privacy-friendly baseline.
   Out of the five evaluated models, one fails to produce data within reasonable computation time and another generates too many jumps to meet the requirements for map matching. The remaining three models succeed to a certain degree in maintaining spatial distribution, one even with DP guarantees. However, all models struggle to produce meaningful sequences of geo-locations with reasonable trip lengths and to model traffic flow at intersections accurately. It is important to note that trip data encompasses various relevant characteristics beyond spatial distribution, such as temporal information, all of which are discarded by these models. Consequently, our results imply that current synthesis models fall short in their promise of high utility and flexibility.

AB  - Data generation techniques are one of the emerging trends in machine learning in the last decade. Despite huge data availability, small datasets are still an issue to tackle for decision making purposes. Synthetic data generation is a promising alternative for the small dataset problem. In addition, previous methodologies address the data generation for only one of the tasks: supervised or unsupervised. A modified Mega-Trend Diffusion (MTD) approach, k-Nearest Neighbor Mega-Trend Diffusion (kNNMTD), is proposed in this research to address these challenges. The method identifies the closest subsamples using the k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm and applies MTD to the subsample neighbors to estimate the domain ranges. The proposed methodology provides the functionality to generate data for any data-driven tasks. kNNMTD is compared with baseline MTD, CTGAN, and synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) for classification tasks as well as against SMOTE for regression (SmoteR) for regression tasks. The proposed method is validated using some of the benchmark datasets as well as the simulated datasets along with a case study. Pairwise correlation difference (PCD) is used to compare the similarity between real and synthetic datasets. kNNMTD outperforms baseline MTD and CTGAN on all the datasets and shows statistical significance of the proposed methodology. Some of the benchmark datasets show low average PCD values as well as the statistical differences against SMOTE and SmoteR using kNNMTD. In the case study, kNNMTD generate data with the lowest PCD values compared to the other methods for both classification (1.2077) and ordinal regression (1.6017) tasks. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The application of modern machine learning to retinal image analyses offers valuable insights into a broad range of human health conditions beyond ophthalmic diseases. Additionally, data sharing is key to fully realizing the potential of machine learning models by providing a rich and diverse collection of training data. However, the personally-identifying nature of retinal images, encompassing the unique vascular structure of each individual, often prevents this data from being shared openly. While prior works have explored image de-identification strategies based on synthetic averaging of images in other domains (e.g. facial images), existing techniques face difficulty in preserving both privacy and clinical utility in retinal images, as we demonstrate in our work. We therefore introduce k-SALSA, a generative adversarial network (GAN)based framework for synthesizing retinal fundus images that summarize a given private dataset while satisfying the privacy notion of k-anonymity. k-SALSA brings together state-of-the-art techniques for training and inverting GANs to achieve practical performance on retinal images. Furthermore, k-SALSA leverages a new technique, called local style alignment, to generate a synthetic average that maximizes the retention of fine-grain visual patterns in the source images, thus improving the clinical utility of the generated images. On two benchmark datasets of diabetic retinopathy (EyePACS and APTOS), we demonstrate our improvement upon existing methods with respect to image fidelity, classification performance, and mitigation of membership inference attacks. Our work represents a step toward broader sharing of retinal images for scientific collaboration. Code is available at https://github.com/hcholab/k-salsa.

AB  - Electricity theft is a global problem that negatively affects both utility companies and electricity users. It destabilizes the economic development of utility companies, causes electric hazards and impacts the high cost of energy for users. The development of smart grids plays an important role in electricity theft detection since they generate massive data that includes customer consumption data which, through machine learning and deep learning techniques, can be utilized to detect electricity theft. This paper introduces the theft detection method which uses comprehensive features in time and frequency domains in a deep neural network-based classification approach. We address dataset weaknesses such as missing data and class imbalance problems through data interpolation and synthetic data generation processes. We analyze and compare the contribution of features from both time and frequency domains, run experiments in combined and reduced feature space using principal component analysis and finally incorporate minimum redundancy maximum relevance scheme for validating the most important features. We improve the electricity theft detection performance by optimizing hyperparameters using a Bayesian optimizer and we employ an adaptive moment estimation optimizer to carry out experiments using different values of key parameters to determine the optimal settings that achieve the best accuracy. Lastly, we show the competitiveness of our method in comparison with other methods evaluated on the same dataset. On validation, we obtained 97% area under the curve (AUC), which is 1% higher than the best AUC in existing works, and 91.8% accuracy, which is the second-best on the benchmark.

AB  - To generate synthetic medical data incorporating image-tabular hybrid data by merging an image encoding/decoding model with a table-compatible generative model and assess their utility. We used 1342 cases from the Stony Brook University Covid-19-positive cases, comprising chest X-ray radiographs (CXRs) and tabular clinical data as a private dataset (pDS). We generated a synthetic dataset (sDS) through the following steps: (I) dimensionally reducing CXRs in the pDS using a pretrained encoder of the auto-encoding generative adversarial networks (alpha GAN) and integrating them with the correspondent tabular clinical data; (II) training the conditional tabular GAN (CTGAN) on this combined data to generate synthetic records, encompassing encoded image features and clinical data; and (III) reconstructing synthetic images from these encoded image features in the sDS using a pretrained decoder of the alpha GAN. The utility of sDS was assessed by the performance of the prediction models for patient outcomes (deceased or discharged). For the pDS test set, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) curve was calculated to compare the performance of prediction models trained separately with pDS, sDS, or a combination of both. We created an sDS comprising CXRs with a resolution of 256 x 256 pixels and tabular data containing 13 variables. The AUC for the outcome was 0.83 when the model was trained with the pDS, 0.74 with the sDS, and 0.87 when combining pDS and sDS for training. Our method is effective for generating synthetic records consisting of both images and tabular clinical data.

AB  - Gliomas observed in medical images require expert neuro-radiologist evaluation for treatment planning and monitoring, motivating development of intelligent systems capable of automating aspects of tumour evaluation. Deep learning models for automatic image segmentation rely on the amount and quality of training data. In this study we developed a neuroimaging synthesis technique to augment data for training fully-convolutional networks (U-nets) to perform automatic glioma segmentation. We used StyleGAN2-ada to simultaneously generate fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance images and corresponding glioma segmentation masks. Synthetic data were successively added to real training data (n = 2751) in fourteen rounds of 1000 and used to train U-nets that were evaluated on held-out validation (n = 590) and test sets (n = 588). U-nets were trained with and without geometric augmentation (translation, zoom and shear), and Dice coefficients were computed to evaluate segmentation performance. We also monitored the number of training iterations before stopping, total training time, and time per iteration to evaluate computational costs associated with training each U-net. Synthetic data augmentation yielded marginal improvements in Dice coefficients (validation set +0.0409, test set +0.0355), whereas geometric augmentation improved generalization (standard deviation between training, validation and test set performances of 0.01 with, and 0.04 without geometric augmentation). Based on the modest performance gains for automatic glioma segmentation we find it hard to justify the computational expense of developing a synthetic image generation pipeline. Future work may seek to optimize the efficiency of synthetic data generation for augmentation of neuroimaging data.

TI  - Exploiting BIM Objects for Synthetic Data Generation toward Indoor Point Cloud Classification Using Deep Learning
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING
LA  - English
KW  - LIDAR
AB  - Advances in technology are leading to more and more devices integrating sensors capable of acquiring data quickly and with high accuracy. Point clouds are no exception. Therefore, there is increased research interest in the large amount of available light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data by point cloud classification using artificial intelligence. Nevertheless, point cloud labeling is a time-consuming task. Hence the amount of labeled data is still scarce. Data synthesis is gaining attention as an alternative to increase the volume of classified data. At the same time, the amount of Building Information Models (BIMs) provided by manufacturers on website databases is increasing. In line with these recent trends, this paper presents a deep-learning framework for classifying point cloud objects based on synthetic data sets created from BIM objects. The method starts by transforming BIM objects into point clouds deriving a data set consisting of 21 object classes characterized with various perturbation patterns. Then, the data set is split into four subsets to carry out the evaluation of synthetic data on the implemented flexible two-dimensional (2D) deep neural framework. In the latter, binary or greyscale images can be generated from point clouds by both orthographic or perspective projection to feed the network. Moreover, the surface variation feature was computed in order to aggregate more geometric information to images and to evaluate how it influences the object classification. The overall accuracy is over 85% in all tests when orthographic images are used. Also, the use of greyscale images representing surface variation improves performance in almost all tests although the computation of this feature may not be robust in point clouds with complex geometry or perturbations.

AB  - Among an electricity provider's non-technical losses, electricity theft has the most severe and dangerous effects. Fraudulent electricity consumption decreases the supply quality, increases generation load, causes legitimate consumers to pay excessive electricity bills, and affects the overall economy. The adaptation of smart grids can significantly reduce this loss through data analysis techniques. The smart grid infrastructure generates a massive amount of data, including the power consumption of individual users. Utilizing this data, machine learning and deep learning techniques can accurately identify electricity theft users. In this paper, an electricity theft detection system is proposed based on a combination of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture. CNN is a widely used technique that automates feature extraction and the classification process. Since the power consumption signature is time-series data, we were led to build a CNN-based LSTM (CNN-LSTM) model for smart grid data classification. In this work, a novel data pre-processing algorithm was also implemented to compute the missing instances in the dataset, based on the local values relative to the missing data point. Furthermore, in this dataset, the count of electricity theft users was relatively low, which could have made the model inefficient at identifying theft users. This class imbalance scenario was addressed through synthetic data generation. Finally, the results obtained indicate the proposed scheme can classify both the majority class (normal users) and the minority class (electricity theft users) with good accuracy.

AB  - This study presents a deep-learning (DL) methodology using 3-D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect defects in carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites through volumetric ultrasonic testing (UT) data. Acquiring large amounts of ultrasonic training data experimentally is expensive and time-consuming. To address this issue, a synthetic data generation method was extended to incorporate volumetric data. By preserving the complete volumetric data, complex preprocessing is reduced, and the model can utilize spatial and temporal information that is lost during imaging. This enables the model to utilize important features that might be overlooked otherwise. The performance of three architectures was compared. The first architecture is prevalent in the literature for the classification of volumetric datasets. The second demonstrated a hand-designed approach to architecture design, with modifications to the first architecture to address the challenges of this specific task. A key modification was the use of cuboidal kernels to account for the large aspect ratios seen in ultrasonic data. The third architecture was discovered through neural architecture search (NAS) from a modified 3-D residual neural network (ResNet) search space. In addition, domain-specific augmentation methods were incorporated during training, resulting in significant improvements in model performance, with a mean accuracy improvement of 22.4% on the discovered architecture. The discovered architecture demonstrated the best performance with a mean accuracy increase of 7.9% over the second-best model. It was able to consistently detect all defects while maintaining a model size smaller than most 2-D ResNets. Each model had an inference time of less than 0.5 s, making them efficient for the interpretation of large amounts of data.

AB  - Industrial bin picking is a challenging task as lots of highly reflective and textureless objects are stacked. Previous methods generally predict gripper configurations or 6-D object pose by expensive industrial 3-D cameras, ignoring the role of consumer-grade red, green, blue, depth (RGB-D) cameras in this task. For highly reflective objects, depth maps of consumer-grade RGB-D cameras are generally of a lower quality with much stronger noise, making it challenging to detect robust grasp poses in stacked industrial scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel grasp detection framework, including a synthetic data generation pipeline, a novel local grasp detection method, and a global search algorithm (GS). Specifically, in the training phase, we utilize the Pybullet and OpenGL to generate synthetic data by approximate 3-D models. We introduce a novel grasp representation and propose MixStyle (MS)-ResUnet to predict and achieve sim2real transfer for this representation. In the testing phase, the object singleness metric (OSM) is proposed for the global search block to evaluate the graspable probability. In addition, the RGB image enhanced by the edge feature is utilized as the input of the network, which can bridge the domain shift. Extensive experiments in real scenes demonstrate that our method can achieve competitive results in grasping disordered metal parts. In over 2400 robotic grasp trials, our method achieves an average success rate of 91.1% in dense stack scenarios. We also confirm that the proposed method can be applied to unseen objects that are not included in the training dataset.

AB  - To obtain high performance, generalization, and accuracy in machine learning applications, such as prediction or anomaly detection, large datasets are a necessary prerequisite. Moreover, the collection of data is time-consuming, difficult, and expensive for many imbalanced or small datasets. These challenges are evident in collecting data for financial and banking services, pharmaceuticals and healthcare, manufacturing and the automobile, robotics car, sensor time-series data, and many more. To overcome the challenges of data collection, researchers in many domains are becoming more and more interested in the development or generation of synthetic data. Generating synthetic time-series data is far more complicated and expensive than generating synthetic tabular data. The primary objective of the paper is to generate multivariate time-series data (for continuous and mixed parameters) that are comparable and evaluated with real multivariate time-series synthetic data. After being trained to produce such data, a novel GAN architecture named as MTS-TGAN is proposed and then assessed using both qualitative measures namely t-SNE, PCA, discriminative and predictive scores as well as quantitative measures, for which an RNN model is implemented, which calculates MAE and MSLE scores for three training phases; Train Real Test Real, Train Real Test Synthetic and Train Synthetic Test Real. The model is able to reduce the overall error up to 13% and 10% in predictive and discriminative scores, respectively. The research's objectives are met, and the outcomes demonstrate that MTS-TGAN is able to pick up on the distribution and underlying knowledge included in the attributes of the real data and it can serve as a starting point for additional research in the respective area.

AB  - Purpose: There has been a proliferation in technologies in the sport performance environment that collect increasingly larger quantities of athlete data. These data have the potential to be personal, sensitive, and revealing and raise privacy and confidentiality concerns. A solution may be the use of synthetic data, which mimic the properties of the original data. The aim of this study was to provide examples of synthetic data generation to demonstrate its practical use and to deploy a freely available web-based R Shiny application to generate synthetic data. Methods: Openly available data from 2 previously published studies were obtained, representing typical data sets of (1) field-and gym-based team-sport external and internal load during a preseason period (n = 28) and (2) performance and subjective changes from before to after the posttraining intervention (n = 22). Synthetic data were generated using the synthpop package in R Studio software, and comparisons between the original and synthetic data sets were made through Welch t tests and the distributional similarity standardized propensity mean squared error statistic. Results: There were no significant differences between the original and more synthetic data sets across all variables examined in both data sets (P > .05). Further, there was distributional similarity (ie, low standardized propensity mean squared error) between the original observed and synthetic data sets. Conclusions: These findings highlight the potential use of synthetic data as a practical solution to privacy and confidentiality issues. Synthetic data can unlock previously inaccessible data sets for exploratory analysis and facilitate multiteam or multicenter collaborations. Interested sport scientists, practitioners, and researchers should consider utilizing the shiny web application (SYNTHETIC DATA-available at https://assetlab.shinyapps.io/SyntheticData/).

AB  - Human skeleton data provides a compact, low noise representation of relative joint locations that may be used in human identity and activity recognition. Hierarchical Co-occurrence Network (HCN) has been used for human activity recognition because of its ability to consider correlation between joints in convolutional operations in the network. HCN shows good identification accuracy but requires a large number of samples to train. Acquisition of this large-scale data can be time consuming and expensive, motivating synthetic skeleton data generation for data augmentation in HCN. We propose a novel method that integrates an Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Network (AC-GAN) and HCN hybrid framework for Assessment and Augmented Identity Recognition for Skeletons (AAIRS). The proposed AAIRS method performs generation and evaluation of synthetic 3-dimensional motion capture skeleton videos followed by human identity recognition. Synthetic skeleton data produced by the generator component of the AC-GAN is evaluated using an Inception Score-inspired realism metric computed from the HCN classifier outputs. We study the effect of increasing the percentage of synthetic samples in the training set on HCN performance. Before synthetic data augmentation, we achieve 74.49% HCN performance in 10-fold cross validation for 9-class human identification. With a synthetic-real mixture of 50%-50%, we achieve 78.22% mean accuracy, significantly (p<0.05) outperforming the baseline HCN performance. The proposed framework demonstrates the feasibility of combining a synthetic data generation architecture with hierarchical co-occurrence feature learning for human identity recognition.

AB  - Recognizing objects and estimating their poses have a wide range of application in robotics. For instance, to grasp objects, robots need the position and orientation of objects in 3D. The task becomes challenging in a cluttered environment with different types of objects. A popular approach to tackle this problem is to utilize a deep neural network for object recognition. However, deep learning-based object detection in cluttered environments requires a substantial amount of data. Collection of these data requires time and extensive human labor for manual labeling. In this study, our objective was the development and validation of a deep object recognition framework using a synthetic depth image dataset. We synthetically generated a depth image dataset of 22 objects randomly placed in a 0.5 m x 0.5 m x 0.1 m box, and automatically labeled all objects with an occlusion rate below 70%. Faster Region Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) architecture was adopted for training using a dataset of 800,000 synthetic depth images, and its performance was tested on a real-world depth image dataset consisting of 2000 samples. Deep object recognizer has 40.96% detection accuracy on the real depth images and 93.5% on the synthetic depth images. Training the deep learning model with noise-added synthetic images improves the recognition accuracy for real images to 46.3%. The object detection framework can be trained on synthetically generated depth data, and then employed for object recognition on the real depth data in a cluttered environment. Synthetic depth data-based deep object detection has the potential to substantially decrease the time and human effort required for the extensive data collection and labeling.

AB  - Bringing artificial intelligence on board Earth observation satellites unlocks unprecedented possibilities to extract actionable items from various image modalities at the global scale in real time. This is of paramount importance nowadays, as downlinking large amounts of imagery is not only prohibitively expensive but also time-consuming. However, building deep learning solutions that could be deployed on board an edge device is challenging due to the limited manually-annotated satellite datasets and hardware constraints of an edge device. This paper addresses these challenges through harnessing a blend of data-centric and model-centric approaches to build a well-generalizing yet efficient and resource-frugal deep learning model for multi-class satellite image classification in the few-shot learning settings. This integrated strategy is formulated to enhance classification performance while accommodating the unique demands of an image analysis chain on board OPS-SAT, a nanosatellite operated by the European Space Agency. The experiments performed over a realworld dataset of OPS-SAT images delves into the interactions between data- and model-centric techniques, underscores the significance of synthesizing artificial training data and emphasizes the value of ensemble learning. However, they also caution against negative transfer in domain adaptation. This study sheds light on effective model training strategies and highlights the multifaceted challenges inherent in deep learning for practical Earth observation, contributing insights to the field of satellite image classification within the constraints of nanosatellite operations.

AB  - Active vision aims to enhance the efficiency of computer vision methods by enabling the capturing sensor, usually placed on a robot or, more generally, an autonomous system, to dynamically adjust its viewpoint, position or parameters in real-time. This capability allows for more precise decision-making by the model. However, training and evaluating an active vision model often necessitates a substantial number of annotated images, which must be captured under various sensor and environmental settings. These diverse images enable the model to learn the underlying dynamics of the active perception process. Unfortunately, collecting and annotating such datasets is a challenging and expensive task. It involves not only providing hand-crafted ground truth annotations but also ensuring that actions, such as moving around / towards / away from a person, are properly "imitated" to enable active vision approaches to model the corresponding active perception dynamics. To address these limitations, in this paper we propose a synthetic facial image generation pipeline specifically designed to support active face recognition, developed using a highly realistic simulation framework based on Unity. The developed pipeline allows for the generation of facial images for a set of persons at various view angles, distances, illumination conditions, and backgrounds. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by training and evaluating a recently proposed embedding-based active face recognizer, as well as extending it to perform 2 axis control, leveraging the additional information provided by the generated dataset. To facilitate replication and encourage the use of the generated dataset for training and evaluating other active vision approaches, we also provide the associated assets and the developed dataset generation pipeline.

AB  - The development of new electric traction machines is a time-consuming process as it involves intensive testing on motor test benches. Machine-Learning-empowered monitoring offers the opportunity to anticipate costly failures early and hence reduce development time. However, machine learning (ML) for process monitoring requires large amounts of training data, especially as the targeted fault states are scarce and yet diverse in their appearances. Therefore, we propose to use synthetic time series data to leverage the high cost of acquiring training data from experiments in real test benches. In this article, we present a novel scheme to generate synthetic data based on a sub-dimensional time series representation. We introduce a highly flexible model by mapping the data to a latent representation and approximating the latent data distribution by a Gaussian Mixture Model. In addition, we propose the Fr ' echet InceptionTime Distance (FITD) as a new distance measure to evaluate the generated data. It allows extracting characteristics at different scales by using multiple kernel sizes. In this way, we ensure that the synthesized data contains characteristics similar to those present in the real data. In our experiment, we train two types of fault detectors, one based on real data of a motor test bench and the other based on synthetic data. We also consider employing fault-aware conditional architectures to generate training data for different fault types explicitly. Our final results show that using synthesized data in the training process increases the performance in terms of classification accuracy score (CAS) up to 29%.

AB  - Data imbalance is a frequently occurring problem in classification tasks where the number of samples in one category exceeds the amount in others. Quite often, the minority class data is of great importance representing concepts of interest and is often challenging to obtain in real-life scenarios and applications. Imagine a customers' dataset for bank loans-majority of the instances belong to non-defaulter class, only a small number of customers would be labeled as defaulters, however, the performance accuracy is more important on defaulters labels than non-defaulter in such highly imbalance datasets. Lack of enough data samples across all the class labels results in data imbalance causing poor classification performance while training the model. Synthetic data generation and oversampling techniques such as SMOTE, AdaSyn can address this issue for statistical data, yet such methods suffer from overfitting and substantial noise. While such techniques have proved useful for synthetic numerical and image data generation using GANs, the effectiveness of approaches proposed for textual data, which can retain grammatical structure, context, and semantic information, has yet to be evaluated. In this paper, we address this issue by assessing text sequence generation algorithms coupled with grammatical validation on domain-specific highly imbalanced datasets for text classification. We exploit recently proposed GPT-2 and LSTM-based text generation models to introduce balance in highly imbalanced text datasets. The experiments presented in this paper on three highly imbalanced datasets from different domains show that the performance of same deep neural network models improve up to 17% when datasets are balanced using generated text.

AB  - PURPOSE Synthetic data are artificial data generated without including any real patient information by an algorithm trained to learn the characteristics of a real source data set and became widely used to accelerate research in life sciences. We aimed to (1) apply generative artificial intelligence to build synthetic data in different hematologic neoplasms; (2) develop a synthetic validation framework to assess data fidelity and privacy preservability; and (3) test the capability of synthetic data to accelerate clinical/translational research in hematology.
   METHODS A conditional generative adversarial network architecture was implemented to generate synthetic data. Use cases were myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and AML: 7,133 patients were included. A fully explainable validation framework was created to assess fidelity and privacy preservability of synthetic data.
   RESULTS We generated MDS/AML synthetic cohorts (including information on clinical features, genomics, treatment, and outcomes) with high fidelity and privacy performances. This technology allowed resolution of lack/incomplete information and data augmentation. We then assessed the potential value of synthetic data on accelerating research in hematology. Starting from 944 patients with MDS available since 2014, we generated a 300% augmented synthetic cohort and anticipated the development of molecular classification and molecular scoring system obtained many years later from 2,043 to 2,957 real patients, respectively. Moreover, starting from 187 MDS treated with luspatercept into a clinical trial, we generated a synthetic cohort that recapitulated all the clinical end points of the study. Finally, we developed a website to enable clinicians generating high-quality synthetic data from an existing biobank of real patients.
   CONCLUSION Synthetic data mimic real clinical-genomic features and outcomes, and anonymize patient information. The implementation of this technology allows to increase the scientific use and value of real data, thus accelerating precision medicine in hematology and the conduction of clinical trials.

AB  - Change detection has played an increasingly important role in multitemporal remote sensing applications recently. Long time series analysis is providing new information of land cover changes and improving the quality and accuracy of the change information being derived from remote sensing. The purpose of this study is to dig for more change temporal information and change pattern information from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image time series (ITS), which is of great significance for monitoring urban area changes, conducting land use surveys, and renovating illegal constructions. In the study, a novel unified framework for long time series SAR image change detection and change pattern analysis (SAR-TSCC) was proposed for land cover change mapping. To obtain the most notable change time rapidly, a fast SAR ITS change point search method based on pruned exact linear time (SAR-PELT) algorithm was adopted. Meanwhile, the deep time series classification network, named SAR time series transformer (SAR-TST), was implemented to recognize the change patterns, which is based on time series transformer (TST) architecture. Considering the lack of real training data, a novel synthetic data generation method is developed. The combination of the synthetic and real data enhanced the generalization of the classifiers. The proposed framework was used for monitoring a large urbanization area in the northwest of Hong Kong, China. The Cosmo Skymed (CSK) time series data acquired from 2013 to 2020 were exploited for land cover change analysis. Experiment results showed that our approach achieved the state-of-the-art performance, as the time accuracy reached 86% and the classification accuracy on the four main change patterns (impulse, step, cycle, and complex) is over 99%. In particular, the proposed SAR-TST model showed remarkable advantages in the presence of insufficient real data.

AB  - This paper compares the probability similarities between a cyberattack, the distributed denial-of-service, and the mathematical model of probability, Levy walks. This comparison aims to explore the validity of Levy walks as a model resembling the DDoS probability features. This research also presents a method, based on the Smirnov transform, for generating synthetic data with the statistical properties of Levy-walks. This method for synthetic data generation can be utilized for generating arbitrary prescribed probability density functions (pdf). The Smirnov transform is used to solve a cybersecurity engineering problem associated with Internet traffic. The synthetic Levy-walk process is intertwined with sections of other distinct characteristics (uniform noise, Gaussian noise, and an ordinary sinusoid) to create a composite signal, which is then analyzed with zero-crossing rate (ZCR) within a varying-size window. This paper shows that it is possible to identify the distinct sections present in the composite signal through ZCR. The differentiation of these sections shows an increasing ZCR value as the section under analysis exhibits a higher activity or complexity (from the sinusoid, to a synthetic Levy-walk process, and uniform and Gaussian noise, respectively). The advantages of the ZCR computation directly in the time-domain are appealing for real-time implementations. The varying window in the ZCR produces more defined values as the window size increases. The changing world of security systems is deeply considered, in an approach for its improvement. This as our society is highly dependent on electronically interconnected systems-of-systems demanding operational robustness and security. The approach proposed for providing a higher degree of security aiming to the development of cognitive security systems.

AB  - Artificial pancreas requires data from multiple sources for accurate insulin dose estimation. These include data from continuous glucose sensors, past insulin dosage information, meal quantity and time and physical activity data. The effectiveness of closed-loop diabetes management systems might be hampered by the absence of these data caused by device error or lack of compliance by patients. In this study, we demonstrate the effect of output sequence length-driven generative and discriminative model selection in high quality data generation and augmentation. This novel generative adversarial network (GAN) based architecture automatically selects the generator and discriminator architecture based on the desired output sequence length. The proposed model is able to generate glucose, physical activity, meal information data for individual patients. The discriminative scores for Ohio T1DM (2018) dataset were 0.17 +/- 0.03 (Inputs: CGM, CHO, Insulin) and 0.15$ +/- 0.02 (Inputs: CGM, CHO, Insulin, Heart Rate, Steps) and for Ohio T1D (2020) dataset was 0.16 +/- 0.02 (Inputs: CGM, CHO, Insulin) and 0.15 +/- 0.02 (Inputs: CGM, CHO, Insulin, acceleration). A mixture of generated and real data was used to test predictive scores for glucose forecasting models. The best RMSE and MARD achieved for OhioT1DM patients were 17.19 +/- 3.22 and 7.14 +/- 1.76 for PH=30 min with CGM, CHO, Insulin, heartrate and steps as inputs. Similarly, the RMSE and MARD for real+synthetic data were 15.63 +/- 2.57 and 5.86 +/- 1.69 respectively. Compared to existing generative models, we demonstrate that sequence length based architecture selection leads to better synthetic data generation for multiple output sequences (CGM, CHO, Insulin) and forecasting accuracy.

AB  - In recent years, deep learning techniques have been developed in the field of storm nowcasting, and they primarily focus on 2-D radar product processing. Deep learning's application to obtaining motion fields is limited by the lack of a motion field ground truth dataset for training. In this article, we propose a method for storm motion estimation based on a point cloud deep learning network, which can perform 3-D motion field estimation on two consecutive frames of weather radar volumetric data. To address the lack of ground truth data, we propose a synthetic data generation method based on Perlin noise and also generate a dataset to train the network. Our model's architecture is based on FlowNet3D. In this sense, we import an attention architecture to improve its ability to embed motion features. We also redesign the loss function to make it suitable for our task. In the experiment section, we first evaluate the performance of the trained model on our synthetic dataset. The experimental results demonstrate the following: first, that the trained network has the ability to estimate 3-D motion from radar point cloud data; second, that it is a robust solution for radar data with different resolutions and observation ranges; and finally, that for the examined task, our proposed architecture has a 5%-15% lower endpoint error than the original. Then, we directly apply the model trained on synthetic data to real cases, demonstrating the feasibility of our trained model on real data. Although motion field is a low-level product when considering a storm's evolutionary process, it has the potential to serve a higher-level purpose, such as lightning or hail nowcasting. The point cloud approach provides a new perspective on weather radar data processing.

AB  - The development of Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) requires labeled network traffic, especially to train and evaluate machine learning approaches. Besides the recording of traffic, the generation of traffic via generative models is a promising approach to obtain vast amounts of labeled data. There exist various machine learning approaches for data generation, but the assessment of the data quality is complex and not standardized. The lack of common quality criteria complicates the comparison of synthetic data generation approaches and synthetic data. Our work addresses this gap in multiple steps. Firstly, we review and categorize existing approaches for evaluating synthetic data in the network traffic domain and other data domains as well. Secondly, based on our review, we compile a setup of metrics that are suitable for the NetFlow domain, which we aggregate into two metrics Data Dissimilarity Score and Domain Dissimilarity Score. Thirdly, we evaluate the proposed metrics on real world data sets, to demonstrate their ability to distinguish between samples from different data sets. As a final step, we conduct a case study to demonstrate the application of the metrics for the evaluation of synthetic data. We calculate the metrics on samples from real NetFlow data sets to define an upper and lower bound for inter- and intra-data set similarity scores. Afterward, we generate synthetic data via Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2 (GPT-2) and apply the metrics to these synthetic data and incorporate these lower bound baseline results to obtain an objective benchmark. The application of the benchmarking process is demonstrated on three NetFlow benchmark data sets, NF-CSE-CIC-IDS2018, NF-ToN-IoT and NF-UNSW-NB15. Our demonstration indicates that this benchmark framework captures the differences in similarity between real world data and synthetic data of varying quality well, and can therefore be used to assess the quality of generated synthetic data.

AB  - BackgroundSynthetic data is an emerging approach for addressing legal and regulatory concerns in biomedical research that deals with personal and clinical data, whether as a single tool or through its combination with other privacy enhancing technologies. Generating uncompromised synthetic data could significantly benefit external researchers performing secondary analyses by providing unlimited access to information while fulfilling pertinent regulations. However, the original data to be synthesized (e.g., data acquired in Living Labs) may consist of subjects' metadata (static) and a longitudinal component (set of time-dependent measurements), making it challenging to produce coherent synthetic counterparts.MethodsThree synthetic time series generation approaches were defined and compared in this work: only generating the metadata and coupling it with the real time series from the original data (A1), generating both metadata and time series separately to join them afterwards (A2), and jointly generating both metadata and time series (A3). The comparative assessment of the three approaches was carried out using two different synthetic data generation models: the Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) and the DoppelGANger (DGAN). The experiments were performed with three different healthcare-related longitudinal datasets: Treadmill Maximal Effort Test (TMET) measurements from the University of Malaga (1), a hypotension subset derived from the MIMIC-III v1.4 database (2), and a lifelogging dataset named PMData (3).ResultsThree pivotal dimensions were assessed on the generated synthetic data: resemblance to the original data (1), utility (2), and privacy level (3). The optimal approach fluctuates based on the assessed dimension and metric.ConclusionThe initial characteristics of the datasets to be synthesized play a crucial role in determining the best approach. Coupling synthetic metadata with real time series (A1), as well as jointly generating synthetic time series and metadata (A3), are both competitive methods, while separately generating time series and metadata (A2) appears to perform more poorly overall.

AB  - ObjectivesTo develop a real-time abdominal T-2 mapping method without requiring breath-holding or respiratory-gating.MethodsThe single-shot multiple overlapping-echo detachment (MOLED) pulse sequence was employed to achieve free-breathing T-2 mapping of the abdomen. Deep learning was used to untangle the non-linear relationship between the MOLED signal and T-2 mapping. A synthetic data generation flow based on Bloch simulation, modality synthesis, and randomization was proposed to overcome the inadequacy of real-world training set.ResultsThe results from simulation and in vivo experiments demonstrated that our method could deliver high-quality T-2 mapping. The average NMSE and R-2 values of linear regression in the digital phantom experiments were 0.0178 and 0.9751. Pearson's correlation coefficient between our predicted T-2 and reference T-2 in the phantom experiments was 0.9996. In the measurements for the patients, real-time capture of the T-2 value changes of various abdominal organs before and after contrast agent injection was realized. A total of 33 focal liver lesions were detected in the group, and the mean and standard deviation of T-2 values were 141.1 +/- 50.0 ms for benign and 63.3 +/- 16.0 ms for malignant lesions. The coefficients of variance in a test-retest experiment were 2.9%, 1.2%, 0.9%, 3.1%, and 1.8% for the liver, kidney, gallbladder, spleen, and skeletal muscle, respectively.ConclusionsFree-breathing abdominal T-2 mapping is achieved in about 100 ms on a clinical MRI scanner. The work paved the way for the development of real-time dynamic T-2 mapping in the abdomen.

AB  - The rapid advance of nanotechnology has led to the development and widespread application of nanomaterials, raising concerns regarding their potential adverse effects on human health and the environment. Traditional (experimental) methods for assessing the nanoparticles (NPs) safety are time-consuming, expensive, and resource-intensive, and raise ethical concerns due to their reliance on animals. To address these challenges, we propose an in silico workflow that serves as an alternative or complementary approach to conventional hazard and risk assessment strategies, which incorporates state-of-the-art computational methodologies. In this study we present an automated machine learning (autoML) scheme that employs dose-response toxicity data for silver (Ag), titanium dioxide (TiO2), and copper oxide (CuO) NPs. This model is further enriched with atomistic descriptors to capture the NPs' underlying structural properties. To overcome the issue of limited data availability, synthetic data generation techniques are used. These techniques help in broadening the dataset, thus improving the representation of different NP classes. A key aspect of this approach is a novel three-step applicability domain method (which includes the development of a local similarity approach) that enhances user confidence in the results by evaluating the prediction's reliability. We anticipate that this approach will significantly expedite the nanosafety assessment process enabling regulation to keep pace with innovation, and will provide valuable insights for the design and development of safe and sustainable NPs. The ML model developed in this study is made available to the scientific community as an easy-to-use web-service through the Enalos Cloud Platform (www.en aloscloud.novamechanics.com/sabydoma/safenanoscope/), facilitating broader access and collaborative advancements in nanosafety.

AB  - The water is the main pivotal sources of irrigation in agricultural activities and affects human daily activities such as drinking. The water quality has a significant impact on various aspects and thus this review aims to addresses existing problems related to water quality prediction methods that have been found in the literature. We explore numerous quality parameters incorporated in the modelling process to measure the quality of water. Furthermore, we review the commonly adopted artificial intelligence-based models which have been utilized to forecast the water quality. 83 studies published from 2009 to 2023 were selected and reviewed based on their success in modelling and forecasting the water quality in multiple regions. We compared these articles in terms of parameters, modelling algorithms, time scale scenarios, and performance measurement indicators. This paper is beneficial to researchers that have interests to conduct future studies related to water quality forecasting. Additionally, we discuss a variety of modelling methods such as deep learning (DL) that have proven to boost the efficiency compared to traditional machine learning (ML) models. As a result, the hybrid-DL models were found to outperform other models such as standalone ML, standalone DL, and hybrid-ML. This study shows a significant limitation of the data-hungry DL models which require a big data size for modelling. Hence, at the end of this review study, we discuss the potential of some methods such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and attention-based transformer to open the door for water quality prediction improvement. GAN has shown promising performance in other domains for synthetic data generation. The potential usage of GAN for water quality domain can overcome the limitations of lack of data and enhance the performance of the predictive models reviewed in this study. Similarly, transformer was found to be state of the art model for time series prediction and thus it can be good candidate to predict water quality.

AB  - Contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM) is an emerging modality for breast cancer diagnosis. This work investigates the feasibility of a computationally-efficient computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system for breast lesion classification. Moreover, to avoid the need for intravenous contrast agents, we investigated the synthesis of contrast-enhanced (SynCESM) images. A total of 504 pairs of low-energy (LE) and CESM images were collected from 160 female subjects. A semi-automatic active-contour method was used for lesion segmentation. Then, 20 morphological and textural features were extracted. To improve the computational efficiency of the proposed system, the wavelet packet transform (WPT) was applied. Then, the same features were extracted from the WPT-approximated segmented lesions. Using LE images, a sigmoid-kernel SVM classifier exhibited a 90.20% accuracy, an 88.39% sensitivity, an 88.26% specificity, and a 0.92 AUC. The per-frame classification time was significantly reduced from 1.1046 s to 0.0734 s with WPT. Using CESM images, we achieved a 93.26% accuracy, a 95.94% sensitivity, a 93.37% specificity, a 0.94 AUC, and a 0.0657 s classification time. Interestingly, with SynCESM images, reasonable performance was still obtained with a 92.14% accuracy, a 93.87% sensitivity, a 91.58% specificity, a 0.93 AUC and a 0.0657 s classification time. Finally, with hybrid pairs of LE and CESM images, we got the best performance with a 96.87% accuracy, a 97.23% sensitivity, a 95.47% specificity, a 0.98 AUC, and a 0.0696 s classification time. The results demonstrate several advantages of the proposed system including its clinical feasibility, lower complexity, and reduced need for contrast agents via synthetic data generation.

AB  - The idea of Augmented Reality (AR) appeared in the early '60s, which recently received a large amount of public attention. AR allows us to work, learn, play, and connect with the world around us both virtually and physically in real-time. However, picking the AR marker to match the users' needs is one of the most challenging tasks due to different marker encryption/decryption methods and essential requirements. Bar-code AR cards are fast and efficient, but they do not contain much visual information; pictorial coloured AR card, on the other hand, is slow and not reliable. This paper proposes a solution to obtain detectable arbitrary pictorial/colour AR cards in real-time by applying the benefit of machine learning and the power of synthetic data generation techniques. This technique solves the issue of labour-intensive tasks of manual annotations when building a massive training dataset of deep-learning. Thus, with a small number of input of the AR-enhanced target figures (as few as one for each coloured card), the synthetic data generated process will produce a deep-learning trainable dataset using computer-graphic rendering techniques (ten of thousands from just one image). Second, the generated dataset is then trained with a chosen object recognition convolutional neural network, acting as the AR marker tracking functionality. Our proposed idea works effectively well without modifying the original contents (of the chosen AR card). The benefits of using synthetic data generated techniques help us to improve the AR marker recognition accuracy and reduce the marker registration time. The trained model is capable of processing video sequences at approximately 25 frames per second without GPU Acceleration, which is suitable for AR experience on the mobile/web platform. We believed that it could be a promising low-cost AR approach in many areas, such as education and gaming.

AB  - Renewable and nonrenewable energy sources are widely incorporated for solar and wind energy that produces electricity without increasing carbon dioxide emissions. Energy industries worldwide are trying hard to predict future energy consumption that could eliminate over or under contracting energy resources and unnecessary financing. Machine learning techniques for predicting energy are the trending solution to overcome the challenges faced by energy companies. The basic need for machine learning algorithms to be trained for accurate prediction requires a considerable amount of data. Another critical factor is balancing the data for enhanced prediction. Data Augmentation is a technique used for increasing the data available for training. Synthetic data are the generation of new data which can be trained to improve the accuracy of prediction models. In this paper, we propose a model that takes time series energy consumption data as input, pre-processes the data, and then uses multiple augmentation techniques and generative adversarial networks to generate synthetic data which when combined with the original data, reduces energy consumption prediction error. We propose TGAN-skipImproved-WGAN-GP to generate synthetic energy consumption time series tabular data. We modify TGAN with skip connections, then improve WGANGP by defining a consistency term, and finally use the architecture of improved WGAN-GP for training TGAN-skip. We used various evaluation metrics and visual representation to compare the performance of our proposed model. We also measured prediction accuracy along with mean and maximum error generated while predicting with different variations of augmented and synthetic data with original data. The mode collapse problem could be handled by TGAN-skip-Improved-WGAN-GP model and it also converged faster than existing GAN models for synthetic data generation. The experiment result shows that our proposed technique of combining synthetic data with original data could significantly reduce the prediction error rate and increase the prediction accuracy of energy consumption.

AB  - Machine learning models trained on small data sets for security applications are especially vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Person identification from LiDAR based skeleton data requires time consuming and expensive data acquisition for each subject identity. Recently, Assessment and Augmented Identity Recognition for Skeletons (AAIRS) has been used to train Hierarchical Co-occurrence Networks for Person Identification (HCN-ID) with small LiDAR based skeleton data sets. However, AAIRS does not evaluate robustness of HCN-ID to adversarial attacks or inoculate the model to defend against such attacks. Popular perturbation-based approaches to generating adversarial attacks are constrained to targeted perturbations added to real training samples, which is not ideal for inoculating models with small training sets. Thus, we propose Attack-AAIRS, a novel addition to the AAIRS framework. Attack-AAIRS leverages a small real data set and a generative adversarial network (GAN) generated synthetic data set to assess and improve model robustness against unseen adversarial attacks. Rather than being constrained to perturbations of limited real training samples, the GAN learns the distribution of adversarial attack samples that exploit weaknesses in HCN-ID. Attack samples drawn from this distribution augment training for inoculation of the HCN-ID to improve robustness. Ten-fold cross validation of Attack-AAIRS yields noticeable increase in robustness to unseen attacks-including Fast Gradient Sign Method, Projected Gradient Descent, Additive Gaussian Noise, Momentum Iterative Fast Gradient Sign Method, and Basic Iterative Method. The HCN-ID Synthetic Data Quality Score for Attack-AAIRS indicates that generated attack samples are of similar quality to the original benign synthetic samples generated by AAIRS. Furthermore, inoculated models show consistent final test accuracy with the original model trained on real data, demonstrating that our method improves robustness to adversarial attacks without reducing testing performance on real data.

AB  - State-of-the-art machine learning algorithms require large amount of high quality data. In practice, however, the sample size is commonly low and data is imbalanced along different class labels. Low sample size and imbalanced class distribution can significantly deteriorate the predictive performance of machine learning models. In order to overcome data quality issues, we propose a novel data augmentation method, Guided Deep Interpolation (GDI). It is based on a convolutional auto-encoder network, which is equipped with an auxiliary linear self-expressive layer. The network is trained by minimizing a composite objective function so that to extract the underlying clustered structure of semantic similarities of data points while high reconstruction quality is also preserved. The trained network is used to define a sampling strategy and a synthetic data generation procedure. Making use of the weights of the self-expressive layer, we introduce a measure of semantic variability to quantify how similar a data point to other data points on average. Based on the proposed measure of semantic variability, a joint distribution is defined. Using the distribution we can draw pairs of similar data points so that one point is semantically underrepresented (isolated) while its pair possesses relatively high semantic variability. A sampled pair is interpolated in the deep feature space of the network so that to increase semantic variability while preserve class label of the semantically underrepresented data point. The trained decoder is used to determine pixel space representations of latent space interpolations. The resulting data augmentation procedure generates synthetic samples by increasing the semantic variability of semantically underrepresented instances in a class label preserving way.
   Our experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms traditional and generative model-based data augmentation methods on low sample size and imbalanced data sets. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In recent years, the medical imaging area showed a notably increased interest in Deep Learning (DL) based applications. Deep learning is a machine learning (ML) technique which learns features and tasks directly from data, trying to model human abstract thinking. Since deep learning can create features without a human intervention, it allows data scientists to use more complex sets of features in comparison with traditional machine learning approaches. In addition to this, the robustness to natural variations in the data is automatically learned and the deep learning architecture is flexible, so that the same neural network based approach can be applied to many different applications and data types. Our goal is to apply DL based techniques in the context of medical imaging with the purpose of developing a workflow for diagnosing cardiovascular pathologies or cerebral aneurysms. Since a major challenge of this approach is the lack of large training databases, in this paper we are focusing on performing data augmentation by generating realistic synthetic anatomical models of blood vessels. For this task we used geometries describing vessel-like structures and also real anatomies extracted from patients. We chose to experiment with two state of the art models: Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). We address the problem of employing neural network based models on three dimensional surfaces. Such surfaces typically have an unstructured representation consisting of points and polygons and are not compatible with typical neural network architectures. We propose a technique based on surface voxelization which consists on representing the unstructured surface mesh as a threedimensional image, therefore becoming inherently compatible with a standard convolutional neural network. We performed experiments on three datasets containing both two and three dimensional surfaces representing blood vessel-like structures. We show that state of the art, deep learning based generative models, are capable of generating voxelized three dimensional surfaces of high quality that are visually indistinguishable from the training samples.

AB  - Despite the proliferation of deep learning techniques for accelerated MRI acquisition and enhanced image reconstruction, the construction of large and diverse MRI datasets continues to pose a barrier to effective clinical translation of these technologies. One major challenge is in collecting the MRI raw data (required for image reconstruction) from clinical scanning, as only magnitude images are typically saved and used for clinical assessment and diagnosis. The image phase and multi-channel RF coil information are not retained when magnitude-only images are saved in clinical imaging archives. Additionally, preprocessing used for data in clinical imaging can lead to biased results. While several groups have begun concerted efforts to collect large amounts of MRI raw data, current databases are limited in the diversity of anatomy, pathology, annotations, and acquisition types they contain. To address this, we present a method for synthesizing realistic MR data from magnitude-only data, allowing for the use of diverse data from clinical imaging archives in advanced MRI reconstruction development. Our method uses a conditional GAN-based framework to generate synthetic phase images from input magnitude images. We then applied ESPIRiT to derive RF coil sensitivity maps from fully sampled real data to generate multi-coil data. The synthetic data generation method was evaluated by comparing image reconstruction results from training Variational Networks either with real data or synthetic data. We demonstrate that the Variational Network trained on synthetic MRI data from our method, consisting of GAN-derived synthetic phase and multi-coil information, outperformed Variational Networks trained on data with synthetic phase generated using current state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we demonstrate that the Variational Networks trained with synthetic k-space data from our method perform comparably to image reconstruction networks trained on undersampled real k-space data.

Predicting failure risk and prioritizing the riskiest asset from a large set of pipelines is one of the demanding tasks for the utilities. Machine learning (ML) application in pipeline failure risk prediction has recently shown promising results. However, due to safety and security concerns, obtaining sufficient operation and failure data to train ML models accurately is a significant challenge. This study employed a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based framework to generate synthetic pipeline data (D-Syn) using a subset (70%) of experimental burst test results data (D-Exp) compiled from the literature to overcome the limitation of accessing operational data. The proposed framework was tested on (1) real data, and (2) combined real and generated synthetic data. The burst failure risk of corroded oil and gas pipelines was determined using probabilistic approaches, and pipelines were classified into two classes depending on their probability of failure: (1) low failure risk (P-f: 0-0.5) and (2) high failure risk (P-f: >0.5). Two random forest (RF) models (M-Exp and M-Comb) were trained using a subset of 70% of actual experimental pipeline data, (D-Exp) and a combination of 70% of actual experimental and 100% of synthetic data, respectively( ) ( ). These models were validated on the remaining subset (30%) of experimental test data. The validation results reveal that adding synthetic data can further improve the performance of the ML models. The area under the ROC Curve was found to be 0.96 and 0.99 for real model (M-Exp) and combined model (M-Comb) data, respectively. The combined model with improved performance can be used in strategic oil and gas pipeline resilience improvement planning, which sets long-term critical decisions regarding maintenance and potential replacement of pipes.

AB  - Most conventional hydrological time series models, used for forecasting or synthetic data generation, are based on the stationary hypothesis. Hydrologic variables such as surface runoff discharge exhibit non-stationary behavior due to the effects of climate change or human activities. In this paper, a new methodology is proposed to analyze the uncertainty of the number and location of breakpoints in runoff time series. The non-stationary runoff time series is simulated by segmenting the series into stationary pieces, which follow an Auto-Regressive Moving Average (ARMA) process, based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle. The length of each piece and the order of the piecewise ARMA model are optimized using the Genetic Algorithm (GA). Several runoff time series with variable lengths are generated based on the observed data and the probability distribution function(s) (PDFs) of breakpoint location(s) are constructed. An optimal set of breakpoint locations are found for each generated runoff time series by minimizing the objective function based on the MDL. Finally, the PDF(s) of breakpoint location(s) is (are) constructed using the results of the mentioned optimization model. To evaluate the proposed methodology, it is applied to the case study of Zayandehrud River in Iran. According to the obtained breakpoint PDF for the runoff time series, three breakpoints around years of 1987, 1996 and 2006 are identified. The results are analyzed by investigating the time series of agricultural lands derived using remote sensing data and studying the impacts of interbasin water transfer projects implemented in the study area. Overall, investigating human-induced changes in the study area confirms the obtained shape of the PDF of runoff breakpoint and shows the good performance of the developed method for finding the number and location of breakpoints in the runoff time series.

AB  - Many deep transfer learning methods for fault diagnosis have been proposed in this decade. Some of the existing methods focus on addressing the problem of fault data scarcity and fault knowledge transfer across different domains with different number of samples. There is still much room to improve considering the best performance so far on imbalanced and transfer fault diagnosis. The existing researches apply synthetic data generation, weighted sample or cost and transfer learning techniques to solve the problem. However, the synthetic samples might not follow the true fault data distribution or exploit excessively over the available small data which could lead to model bias or overfitting. In addition, the value of the abundant normal condition data has not been well explored which may carry essential information for fault discrimination. To address these problems, a novel two stage transferable common feature space mining method for fault diagnosis is developed which is termed as Common Feature and Compare Net (CFCNet). The fault diagnosis task has been divided into two stages, common feature learning and fault category diagnosis. In the first stage, CFCNet trains a weakly supervised domain adaptive convolutional Autoencoder to learn the common features underlying multi-domain data, which makes efficient use of all the available data and is termed as Common Feature Net. In the second stage, the trained Common Feature Net and a Unique Feature Net is combined to construct a dual-channel fea-ture extraction and comparison architecture. CFCNet could mine both the transferable com-mon features and unique features of different faults. Based on a feature concatenation and similarity computation structure, CFCNet enables an efficient similarity estimation mecha-nism for fault diagnosis. Training strategy of few shot learning is adopted to train CFCNet which can balance the training progress instead of the imbalanced data. Extensive experi-ments have verified the superior performance of the proposed method.

AB  - The development of smart grids, traditional power grids, and the integration of internet of things devices have resulted in a wealth of data crucial to advancing energy management and efficiency. Nevertheless, public datasets remain limited due to grid operators' and companies' reluctance to disclose proprietary information. The authors present a comprehensive analysis of more than 50 publicly available datasets, organised into three main categories: micro- and macro-consumption data, detailed in-home consumption data (often referred to as non-intrusive load monitoring datasets or building data) and grid data. Furthermore, the study underscores future research priorities, such as advancing synthetic data generation, improving data quality and standardisation, and enhancing big data management in smart grids. The aim of the authors is to enable researchers in the smart and power grid a comprehensive reference point to pick suitable and relevant public datasets to evaluate their proposed methods. The provided analysis highlights the importance of following a systematic and standardised approach in evaluating future methods and directs readers to future potential venues of research in the area of smart grid analytics.
   The authors offer an exhaustive review and analysis of over 50 publicly available smart grid datasets, segmented into micro and macro consumption, in-home consumption, and grid data. Aimed at simplifying dataset selection for energy management, grid optimisation, and internet of things applications, the research identifies gaps and challenges in the field. The work not only serves as a structured guide for researchers navigating the intricate, data-rich landscape of modern electrical grids but also contributes to the development of more sustainable, efficient, and resilient energy systems. image

AB  - BackgroundThree-way data started to gain popularity due to their increasing capacity to describe inherently multivariate and temporal events, such as biological responses, social interactions along time, urban dynamics, or complex geophysical phenomena. Triclustering, subspace clustering of three-way data, enables the discovery of patterns corresponding to data subspaces (triclusters) with values correlated across the three dimensions (observations x features x contexts). With increasing number of algorithms being proposed, effectively comparing them with state-of-the-art algorithms is paramount. These comparisons are usually performed using real data, without a known ground-truth, thus limiting the assessments. In this context, we propose a synthetic data generator, G-Tric, allowing the creation of synthetic datasets with configurable properties and the possibility to plant triclusters. The generator is prepared to create datasets resembling real 3-way data from biomedical and social data domains, with the additional advantage of further providing the ground truth (triclustering solution) as output.ResultsG-Tric can replicate real-world datasets and create new ones that match researchers needs across several properties, including data type (numeric or symbolic), dimensions, and background distribution. Users can tune the patterns and structure that characterize the planted triclusters (subspaces) and how they interact (overlapping). Data quality can also be controlled, by defining the amount of missing, noise or errors. Furthermore, a benchmark of datasets resembling real data is made available, together with the corresponding triclustering solutions (planted triclusters) and generating parameters.ConclusionsTriclustering evaluation using G-Tric provides the possibility to combine both intrinsic and extrinsic metrics to compare solutions that produce more reliable analyses. A set of predefined datasets, mimicking widely used three-way data and exploring crucial properties was generated and made available, highlighting G-Tric's potential to advance triclustering state-of-the-art by easing the process of evaluating the quality of new triclustering approaches.

AB  - Background :Single-sample (screening) rule-out of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with troponin requires derivation of a single-test screening threshold. In data sets with small event numbers, the lowest one or two concentrations of myocardial infarction (MI) patients dictate the threshold. This is not optimal. We aimed to demonstrate a process incorporating both real and synthetic data for deriving such thresholds using a novel pre-production high-precision point-of-care assay. Methods: cTnI concentrations were measured from thawed plasma using the Troponin I Next (TnI-Nx) assay (i-STAT; Abbott) in adults on arrival to the emergency department with symptoms suggestive of AMI. The primary outcome was an AMI or cardiac death within 30 days. We used internal-external validation with synthetic data production based on clinical and demographic data, plus the measured TnI-Nx concentration, to derive and validate decision thresholds for TnI-Nx. The target low-risk threshold was a sensitivity of 99% and a high-risk threshold specificity of >95%. Results: In total, 1356 patients were included, of whom 191 (14.1%) had the primary outcome. A total of 500 synthetic data sets were constructed. The mean low-risk threshold was determined to be 5 ng/L. This categorized 38% (95% CI, 6%-68%) to low-risk with a sensitivity of 99.0% (95% CI, 98.6%-99.5%) and a negative predictive value of 99.4% (95% CI, 97.6%-99.8%). A similarly derived high-risk threshold of 25 ng/L had a specificity of 95.0% (95% CI, 94.8%-95.1%) and a positive predictive value of 74.8% (95% CI, 71.5%-78.0%). Conclusions: With the TnI-Nx assay, we successfully demonstrated an approach using synthetic data generation to derive low-risk thresholds for safe and effective screening.

AB  - Disagreement among text annotators as a part of a human (expert) labeling process produces noisy labels, which affect the performance of supervised learning algorithms for natural language processing. Using only high agreement annotations introduces another challenge: the data imbalance problem. We study this challenge within the problem of relating user comments to the content of a news article. We show that traditional techniques for learning from imbalanced data, such as oversampling, using weighted loss functions, or assigning weak labels using crowdsourcing, may not be sufficient for modeling complex temporal relationships between news articles and user comments. In this study, we propose a framework for aligning comments and articles 1) from imbalanced news data characterized with 2) different degrees of annotator agreement, under 3) a constrained budget for human labeling and computing resources. Within the framework, we propose a Semi-Automatic Labeling solution based on Human-AI collaboration. We compare our proposed technique with traditional data imbalance handling techniques and synthetic data generation on the article-comment alignment problem, where the goal is to determine a category of an article-comment pair that represents how relevant the comment is to the article. Finding an effective and efficient solution is essential because it is time-consuming and prohibitively costly to manually label a sufficiently large amount of article-comment pairs based on the semantic understanding of an article and its comments. We discover that the Human-AI collaboration outperforms all alternative techniques by 17% of article-comment alignment accuracy. When there is no time or budget for re-labeling some article-comment pairs, we found that synonym augmentation is a reasonable alternative. We also provide a detailed analysis of the effect of humans in the loop and the use of unlabeled data.

AB  - Unbalanced sample groups tend to yield models with a higher prevalence of predominant classes. A sample group with balanced classes contributes to the development of more robust models with improved predictive capability to classify classes equally. In the literature, two methodologies for sample balancing can be found: elimination (undersampling) and synthetic sample generation (oversampling). Undersampling methodologies result in the loss of real samples, while oversampling methods may introduce issues related to adding non -real signals to the original spectra. To overcome these challenges, this paper aimed to utilize Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for the generation of virtual samples (synthetic samples and artificial outliers) to balance data in multivariate classification models. The proposed methodology was applied to data from mid -infrared spectroscopy (MIR) and high -resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) with Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models. The constructed models demonstrate that the addition of virtual samples enhances performance parameters (e.g., false negative rate, false positive rate, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, among others) compared to unbalanced models, while also mitigating overfitting (a problem found in unbalanced models). Performance parameters exhibited a more significant improvement percentage using the nonlinear model (SVM) compared to the linear model (PLS-DA). Furthermore, the created virtual spectra do not introduce new signals, i.e., original, and virtual spectra exhibit a similar spectral profile, differing only in the intensity levels. Finally, all models demonstrated good predictive capability according to permutation testing for the binary model developed in this work, limiting the rate of class permutation retention (between 40 % and 60 % of the y -vector remained in the original class).

AB  - Safety management is a priority to guarantee human-centered manufacturing processes in the context of Industry 5.0, which aims to realize a safe human-machine environment based on knowledge-driven approaches. The traditional approaches for safety management in the industrial environment include staff training, regular inspections, warning signs, etc. Despite the fact that proactive measures and procedures have exceptional importance in the prevention of safety hazards, human-machine-environment coupling requires more sophisticated approaches able to provide automated, reliable, real-time, cost-effective, and adaptive hazard identification in complex manufacturing processes. In this context, the use of virtual reality (VR) can be exploited not only as a means of human training but also as part of the methodology to generate synthetic datasets for training AI models. In this paper, we propose a flexible and adjustable detection system that aims to enhance safety management in Industry 5.0 manufacturing through real-time monitoring and identification of hazards. The first stage of the system contains the synthetic data generation methodology, aiming to create a synthetic dataset via VR, while the second one concerns the training of AI object detectors for real-time inference. The methodology is evaluated by comparing the performance of models trained on both real-world data from a publicly available dataset and our generated synthetic data. Additionally, through a series of experiments, the optimal ratio of synthetic and real-world images is determined for training the object detector. It has been observed that even with a small amount of real-world data, training a robust AI model is achievable. Finally, we use the proposed methodology to generate a synthetic dataset of four classes as well as to train an AI algorithm for real-time detection.

KW  - data analytics
AB  - The increasing significance of data analytics in modern information analysis is underpinned by vast amounts of user data. However, it is only feasible to amass sufficient data for various tasks in specific data-gathering contexts that either have limited security information or are associated with older applications. There are numerous scenarios where a domain is too new, too specialized, too secure, or data are too sparsely available to adequately support data analytics endeavors. In such cases, synthetic data generation becomes necessary to facilitate further analysis. To address this challenge, we have developed an Algorithm-based Data Generation (ADG) Engine that enables data generation without the need for initial data, relying instead on user behavior patterns, including both normal and abnormal behavior. The ADG Engine uses a structured database system to keep track of users across different types of activity. It then uses all of this information to make the generated data as real as possible. Our efforts are particularly focused on data analytics, achieved by generating abnormalities within the data and allowing users to customize the generation of normal and abnormal data ratios. In situations where obtaining additional data through conventional means would be impractical or impossible, especially in the case of specific characteristics like anomaly percentages, algorithmically generated datasets provide a viable alternative. In this paper, we introduce the ADG Engine, which can create coherent datasets for multiple users engaged in different activities and across various platforms, entirely from scratch. The ADG Engine incorporates normal and abnormal ratios within each data platform through the application of core algorithms for time-based and numeric-based anomaly generation. The resulting abnormal percentage is compared against the expected values and ranges from 0.13 to 0.17 abnormal data instances in each column. Along with the normal/abnormal ratio, the results strongly suggest that the ADG Engine has successfully completed its primary task.

AB  - One of the main problems in the application of machine learning techniques is the need for large amounts of data necessary to obtain a well-generalizing model. This is exacerbated for studies in which it is not possible to access large amounts of data-for example, in the case of ship main data modelling, where a limited amount of real-world data (ship main data) is available for dataset creation. In this paper, a synthetic data generation technique has been applied to generate a large amount of synthetic data points regarding container ships' main particulars. Models are trained using a multilayer perceptron (MLP) regressor on both original and synthetic data mixed with original data points. Then, the authors validate the performance of the obtained models on the original data and conclude whether a synthetic-data-based approach can be used to develop models in instances where the amount of data on ship main particulars may be limited. The results demonstrate an improvement across almost all outputs, ranging between 0.01 and 0.21 when evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R2) and between 0.27% and 3.43% when models are evaluated with mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). This indicates that the application of synthetic data can indeed be used for the improvement of ML-based model performance. The presented study demonstrates that the application of ML-based syncretization techniques can provide significant improvements to the process of ML-based determination of a ship's main particulars at the early design stage. This paper suggests that, in cases where only a small dataset is available, artificial neural networks (ANN) can still be effectively employed to derive early-stage design values for the main particulars through the use of synthetic data.

AB  - Fermentation is an age-old technique used to preserve food by restoring proper microbial balance. Boiled barley and nuruk are fermented for a short period to produce Shindari, a traditional beverage for the people of Jeju, South Korea. Shindari has been proven to be a drink of multiple health benefits if fermented for an optimal period. It is necessary to predict the ideal fermentation time required by each microbial community to keep the advantages of the microorganisms produced by the fermentation process in Shindari intact and to eliminate contamination. Prediction through machine learning requires past data but the process of obtaining fermentation data of Shindari is time consuming, expensive, and not easily available. Therefore, there is a need to generate synthetic fermentation data to explore various benefits of the drink and to reduce any risk from overfermentation. In this paper, we propose a model that takes incomplete tabular fermentation data of Shindari as input and uses multiple imputation ensemble (MIE) and generative adversarial networks (GAN) to generate synthetic fermentation data that can be later used for prediction and microbial spoilage control. For multiple imputation, we used multivariate imputation by chained equations and random forest imputation, and ensembling was done using the bagging and stacking method. For generating synthetic data, we remodeled the tabular GAN with skip connections and adapted the architecture of Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty. We compared the performance of our model with other imputation and ensemble models using various evaluation metrics and visual representations. Our GAN model could overcome the mode collapse problem and converged at a faster rate than existing GAN models for synthetic data generation. Experiment results show that our proposed model executes with less error, is more accurate, and generates significantly better synthetic fermentation data compared to other models.

TI  - Predicting asthma using imbalanced data modeling techniques: Evidence from 2019 Michigan BRFSS data
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - Studies in the past have examined asthma prevalence and the associated risk factors in the United States using data from national surveys. However, the findings of these studies may not be relevant to specific states because of the different environmental and socioeconomic factors that vary across regions. The 2019 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) showed that Michigan had higher asthma prevalence rates than the national average. In this regard, we employ various modern machine learning techniques to predict asthma and identify risk factors associated with asthma among Michigan adults using the 2019 BRFSS data. After data cleaning, a sample of 10,337 individuals was selected for analysis, out of which 1,118 individuals (10.8%) reported having asthma during the survey period. Typical machine learning techniques often perform poorly due to imbalanced data issues. To address this challenge, we employed two synthetic data generation techniques, namely the Random Over-Sampling Examples (ROSE) and Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE) and compared their performances. The overall performance of machine learning algorithms was improved using both methods, with ROSE performing better than SMOTE. Among the ROSE-adjusted models, we found that logistic regression, partial least squares, gradient boosting, LASSO, and elastic net had comparable performance, with sensitivity at around 50% and area under the curve (AUC) at around 63%. Due to ease of interpretability, logistic regression is chosen for further exploration of risk factors. Presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lower income, female sex, financial barrier to see a doctor due to cost, taken flu shot/spray in the past 12 months, 18-24 age group, Black, non-Hispanic group, and presence of diabetes are identified as asthma risk factors. This study demonstrates the potentiality of machine learning coupled with imbalanced data modeling approaches for predicting asthma from a large survey dataset. We conclude that the findings could guide early screening of at-risk asthma patients and designing appropriate interventions to improve care practices.

AB  - Background and Objective: Cerebral microbleeds (CMB) are important biomarkers of cerebrovascular dis-eases and cognitive dysfunctions. Susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) is a common MRI sequence where CMB appear as small hypointense blobs. The prevalence of CMB in the population and in each scan is low, resulting in tedious and time-consuming visual assessment. Automated detection methods would be of value but are challenged by the CMB low prevalence, the presence of mimics such as blood vessels, and the difficulty to obtain sufficient ground truth for training and testing. In this paper, synthetic CMB (sCMB) generation using an analytical model is proposed for training and testing machine learning methods. The main aim is creating perfect synthetic ground truth as similar as reals, in high number, with a high diversity of shape, volume, intensity, and location to improve training of supervised methods.
   Method: sCMB were modelled with a random Gaussian shape and added to healthy brain locations. We compared training on our synthetic data to standard augmentation techniques. We performed a validation experiment using sCMB and report result for whole brain detection using a 10-fold cross validation design with an ensemble of 10 neural networks.
   Results: Performance was close to state of the art (similar to 9 false positives per scan), when random forest was trained on synthetic only and tested on real lesion. Other experiments showed that top detection performance could be achieved when training on synthetic CMB only. Our dataset is made available, including a version with 37,0 0 0 synthetic lesions, that could be used for benchmarking and training.
   Conclusion: Our proposed synthetic microbleeds model is a powerful data augmentation approach for CMB classification with and should be considered for training automated lesion detection system from MRI SWI. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In emerging 5G networks, User Equipment camps traditionally on 4G network. Later, if the user requests a 5G service, it can simultaneously camp on 4G and 5G using EUTRAN New-Radio Dual-Connectivity (EN-DC) approach. In EN-DC, poor radio-conditions in either 4G or 5G network can be detrimental to user Quality-of-Experience (QoE). Although operators want to maximize EN-DC activation to fully utilize the 5G network, sub-optimal parameter configuration to turn on ENDC can compromise key-performance-indicators due to excessive radio-link-failures (RLFs) or voice-muting. While the need to maximize the EN-DC activation is obvious for maximizing the 5G network's utility, RLF and mute avoidance are vital to maintain the QoE requirements. To achieve aforementioned tradeoff, this paper presents the first solution to optimally configure the EN-DC activation parameters. We collect two datasets from real network to develop machine-learning-models to predict RLF and muting, respectively. We also investigate and compare the potential of various under-sampling, oversampling, and synthetic data generation techniques including Tomek-Links and Generative Adversarial Networks for their potential to address the data imbalance problem inherent in the real network training data. Leveraging these models, we formulate and solve two QoE-aware optimization problems that can maximize EN-DC activation while minimizing RLF or voice-muting. System-level simulation-based results show that compared to state-of-the-art solution that does not take into account RLF or voice-muting risk in EN-DC activation, the proposed solution can intelligently determine ENDC activation criteria that minimize the risk of RLF and voice muting while giving the operator's desired level of priority to maximize 5G network utilization.

AB  - This paper proposes a one-to-one trajectory synthetization method with stable long-term individual mobility behavior based on a generalizable area embedding. Previous methods concentrate on producing highly detailed data on short-term and restricted areas for, e.g., autonomous driving scenarios. Another possibility consists of city-wide and beyond scales that can be used to predict general traffic flows. The now-presented approach takes the tracked mobility behavior of individuals and creates coherent synthetic mobility data. These generated data reflect the person's long-term mobility behavior, guaranteeing location persistency and sound embedding within the point-of-interest structure of the observed area. After an analysis and clustering step of the original data, the area is distributed into a geospatial grid structure (H3 is used here). The neighborhood relationships between the grids are interpreted as a graph. A feed-forward autoencoder and a graph encoding-decoding network generate a latent space representation of the area. The original clustered data are associated with their respective H3 grids. With a greedy algorithm approach and concerning privacy strategies, new combinations of grids are generated as top-level patterns for individual mobility behavior. Based on the original data, concrete locations within the new grids are found and connected to ways. The goal is to generate a dataset that shows equivalence in aggregated characteristics and distances in comparison with the original data. The described method is applied to a sample of 120 from a study with 1000 participants whose mobility data were generated in the city of Munich in Germany. The results show the applicability of the approach in generating synthetic data, enabling further research on individual mobility behavior and patterns. The result comprises a sharable dataset on the same abstraction level as the input data, which can be beneficial for different applications, particularly for machine learning.

AB  - Clinical data analysis could lead to breakthroughs. However, clinical data contain sensitive information about participants that could be utilized for unethical activities, such as blackmailing, identity theft, mass surveillance, or social engineering. Data anonymization is a standard step during data collection, before sharing, to overcome the risk of disclosure. However, conventional data anonymization techniques are not foolproof and also hinder the opportunity for personalized evaluations. Much research has been done for synthetic data generation using generative adversarial networks and many other machine learning methods; however, these methods are either not free to use or are limited in capacity. This study evaluates the performance of an emerging tool named synthpop, an R package producing synthetic data as an alternative approach for data anonymization. This paper establishes data standards derived from the original data set based on the utilities and quality of information and measures variations in the synthetic data set to evaluate the performance of the data synthesis process. The methods to assess the utility of the synthetic data set can be broadly divided into two approaches: general utility and specific utility. General utility assesses whether synthetic data have overall similarities in the statistical properties and multivariate relationships with the original data set. Simultaneously, the specific utility assesses the similarity of a fitted model's performance on the synthetic data to its performance on the original data. The quality of information is assessed by comparing variations in entropy bits and mutual information to response variables within the original and synthetic data sets. The study reveals that synthetic data succeeded at all utility tests with a statistically non-significant difference and not only preserved the utilities but also preserved the complexity of the original data set according to the data standard established in this study. Therefore, synthpop fulfills all the necessities and unfolds a wide range of opportunities for the research community, including easy data sharing and information protection.

AB  - The future of cellular networks is contingent on artificial intelligence (AI) based automation, particularly for radio access network (RAN) operation, optimization, and troubleshooting. To achieve such zero-touch automation, a myriad of AI-based solutions are being proposed in literature to leverage AI for modeling and optimizing network behavior to achieve the zero-touch automation goal. However, to work reliably, AI based automation, requires a deluge of training data. Consequently, the success of the proposed AI solutions is limited by a fundamental challenge faced by cellular network research community: scarcity of the training data. In this paper, we present an extensive review of classic and emerging techniques to address this challenge. We first identify the common data types in RAN and their known use-cases. We then present a taxonomized survey of techniques used in literature to address training data scarcity for various data types. This is followed by a framework to address the training data scarcity. The proposed framework builds on available information and combination of techniques including interpolation, domain-knowledge based, generative adversarial neural networks, transfer learning, autoencoders, few-shot learning, simulators and testbeds. Potential new techniques to enrich scarce data in cellular networks are also proposed, such as by matrix completion theory, and domain knowledge-based techniques leveraging different types of network geometries and network parameters. In addition, an overview of state-of-the art simulators and testbeds is also presented to make readers aware of current and emerging platforms to access real data in order to overcome the data scarcity challenge. The extensive survey of training data scarcity addressing techniques combined with proposed framework to select a suitable technique for given type of data, can assist researchers and network operators in choosing the appropriate methods to overcome the data scarcity challenge in leveraging AI to radio access network automation.

AB  - Background: Obesity is a leading cause of preventable death worldwide. Artificial intelligence (AI), characterized by machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), has become an indispensable tool in obesity research.
   Objective: This scoping review aimed to provide researchers and practitioners with an overview of the AI applications to obesity research, familiarize them with popular ML and DL models, and facilitate the adoption of AI applications.
   Methods: We conducted a scoping review in PubMed and Web of Science on the applications of AI to measure, predict, and treat obesity. We summarized and categorized the AI methodologies used in the hope of identifying synergies, patterns, and trends to inform future investigations. We also provided a high-level, beginner-friendly introduction to the core methodologies to facilitate the dissemination and adoption of various AI techniques.
   Results: We identified 46 studies that used diverse ML and DL models to assess obesity-related outcomes. The studies found AI models helpful in detecting clinically meaningful patterns of obesity or relationships between specific covariates and weight outcomes. The majority (18/22, 82%) of the studies comparing AI models with conventional statistical approaches found that the AI models achieved higher prediction accuracy on test data. Some (5/46, 11%) of the studies comparing the performances of different AI models revealed mixed results, indicating the high contingency of model performance on the data set and task it was applied to. An accelerating trend of adopting state-of-the-art DL models over standard ML models was observed to address challenging computer vision and natural language processing tasks. We concisely introduced the popular ML and DL models and summarized their specific applications in the studies included in the review.
   Conclusions: This study reviewed AI-related methodologies adopted in the obesity literature, particularly ML and DL models applied to tabular, image, and text data. The review also discussed emerging trends such as multimodal or multitask AI models, synthetic data generation, and human-in-the-loop that may witness increasing applications in obesity research.

AB  - Multimodal fusion is becoming more common as it proves to be a powerful approach to identify complementary information from multimodal datasets. However, simulation of joint information is not straightforward. Published approaches mostly employ limited, provisional designs that often break the link between the model assumptions and the data for the sake of demonstrating properties of fusion techniques. This work introduces a new approach to synthetic data generation which allows full-compliance between data and model while still representing realistic spatiotemporal features in accordance with the current neuroimaging literature. The focus is on the simulation of joint information for the verification of stochastic linear models, particularly those used in multimodal data fusion of brain imaging data.
   Our first goal is to obtain a benchmark ground-truth in which estimation errors due to model mismatch are minimal or none. Then we move on to assess how estimation is affected by gradually increasing model discrepancies toward a more realistic dataset. The key aspect of our approach is that it permits complete control over the type and level of model mismatch, allowing for more educated inferences about the limitations and caveats of select stochastic linear models. As a result, impartial comparison of models is possible based on their performance in multiple different scenarios.
   Our proposed method uses the commonly overlooked theory of copulas to enable full control of the type and level of dependence/association between modalities, with no occurrence of spurious multimodal associations. Moreover, our approach allows for arbitrary single-modality marginal distributions for any fixed choice of dependence/association between multimodal features. Using our simulation framework, we can rigorously challenge the assumptions of several existing multimodal fusion approaches.
   Our study brings a new perspective to the problem of simulating multimodal data that can be used for ground-truth verification of various stochastic multimodal models available in the literature, and reveals some important aspects that are not captured or are overlooked by ad hoc simulations that lack a firm statistical motivation.

AB  - Background: Privacy restrictions limit access to protected patient-derived health information for research purposes. Consequently, data anonymization is required to allow researchers data access for initial analysis before granting institutional review board approval. A system installed and activated at our institution enables synthetic data generation that mimics data from real electronic medical records, wherein only fictitious patients are listed.
   Objective: This paper aimed to validate the results obtained when analyzing synthetic structured data for medical research. A comprehensive validation process concerning meaningful clinical questions and various types of data was conducted to assess the accuracy and precision of statistical estimates derived from synthetic patient data.
   Methods: A cross-hospital project was conducted to validate results obtained from synthetic data produced for five contemporary studies on various topics. For each study, results derived from synthetic data were compared with those based on real data. In addition, repeatedly generated synthetic datasets were used to estimate the bias and stability of results obtained from synthetic data.
   Results: This study demonstrated that results derived from synthetic data were predictive of results from real data. When the number of patients was large relative to the number of variables used, highly accurate and strongly consistent results were observed between synthetic and real data. For studies based on smaller populations that accounted for confounders and modifiers by multivariate models, predictions were of moderate accuracy, yet clear trends were correctly observed.
   Conclusions: The use of synthetic structured data provides a close estimate to real data results and is thus a powerful tool in shaping research hypotheses and accessing estimated analyses, without risking patient privacy. Synthetic data enable broad access to data (eg, for out-of-organization researchers), and rapid, safe, and repeatable analysis of data in hospitals or other health organizations where patient privacy is a primary value.

AB  - Current capsule endoscopes and next-generation robotic capsules for diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases are complex cyber-physical platforms that must orchestrate complex software and hardware functions. The desired tasks for these systems include visual localization, depth estimation, 3D mapping, disease detection and segmentation, automated navigation, active control, path realization and optional therapeutic modules such as targeted drug delivery and biopsy sampling. Data-driven algorithms promise to enable many advanced functionalities for capsule endoscopes, but real-world data is challenging to obtain. Physically-realistic simulations providing synthetic data have emerged as a solution to the development of data-driven algorithms. In this work, we present a comprehensive simulation platform for capsule endoscopy operations and introduce VR-Caps, a virtual active capsule environment that simulates a range of normal and abnormal tissue conditions (e.g., inflated, dry, wet etc.) and varied organ types, capsule endoscope designs (e.g., mono, stereo, dual and 360 degrees camera), and the type, number, strength, and placement of internal and external magnetic sources that enable active locomotion. VR-Caps makes it possible to both independently or jointly develop, optimize, and test medical imaging and analysis software for the current and next-generation endoscopic capsule systems. To validate this approach, we train state-of-the-art deep neural networks to accomplish various medical image analysis tasks using simulated data from VR-Caps and evaluate the performance of these models on real medical data. Results demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed virtual platform in developing algorithms that quantify fractional coverage, camera trajectory, 3D map reconstruction, and disease classification. All of the code, pre-trained weights and created 3D organ models of the virtual environment with detailed instructions how to setup and use the environment are made publicly available at https://github.com/CapsuleEndoscope/VirtualCapsuleEndoscopy and a video demonstration can be seen in the supplementary videos (Video-I).

AB  - Crowd analysis via computer vision techniques is an important topic in the field of video surveillance, which has wide-spread applications including crowd monitoring, public safety, space design and so on. Pixel-wise crowd understanding is the most fundamental task in crowd analysis because of its finer results for video sequences or still images than other analysis tasks. Unfortunately, pixel-level understanding needs a large amount of labeled training data. Annotating them is an expensive work, which causes that current crowd datasets are small. As a result, most algorithms suffer from over-fitting to varying degrees. In this paper, take crowd counting and segmentation as examples from the pixel-wise crowd understanding, we attempt to remedy these problems from two aspects, namely data and methodology. Firstly, we develop a free data collector and labeler to generate synthetic and labeled crowd scenes in a computer game, Grand Theft Auto V. Then we use it to construct a large-scale, diverse synthetic crowd dataset, which is named as "GCC Dataset". Secondly, we propose two simple methods to improve the performance of crowd understanding via exploiting the synthetic data. To be specific, (1) supervised crowd understanding: pre-train a crowd analysis model on the synthetic data, then fine-tune it using the real data and labels, which makes the model perform better on the real world; (2) crowd understanding via domain adaptation: translate the synthetic data to photo-realistic images, then train the model on translated data and labels. As a result, the trained model works well in real crowd scenes.Extensive experiments verify that the supervision algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art performance on four real datasets: UCF_CC_50, UCF-QNRF, and Shanghai Tech Part A/B Dataset. The above results show the effectiveness, values of synthetic GCC for the pixel-wise crowd understanding. The tools of collecting/labeling data, the proposed synthetic dataset and the source code for counting models are available at.

AB  - This paper presents datasets utilised for synthetic near-infrared (NIR) image generation and bounding-box level fruit detection systems. A high-quality dataset is one of the essential building blocks that can lead to success in model generalisation and the deployment of data-driven deep neural networks. In particular, synthetic data generation tasks often require more training samples than other supervised approaches. Therefore, in this paper, we share the NIR+RGB datasets that are re-processed from two public datasets (i.e., nirscene and SEN12MS), expanded our previous study, deepFruits, and our novel NIR+RGB sweet pepper (capsicum) dataset. We oversampled from the original nirscene dataset at 10, 100, 200, and 400 ratios that yielded a total of 127 k pairs of images. From the SEN12MS satellite multispectral dataset, we selected Summer (45 k) and All seasons (180k) subsets and applied a simple yet important conversion: digital number (DN) to pixel value conversion followed by image standardisation. Our sweet pepper dataset consists of 1615 pairs of NIR+RGB images that were collected from commercial farms. We quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrate that these NIR+RGB datasets are sufficient to be used for synthetic NIR image generation. We achieved Frechet inception distances (FIDs) of 11.36, 26.53, and 40.15 for nirscene1, SEN12MS, and sweet pepper datasets, respectively. In addition, we release manual annotations of 11 fruit bounding boxes that can be exported in various formats using cloud service. Four newly added fruits (blueberry, cherry, kiwi and wheat) compound 11 novel bounding box datasets on top of our previous work presented in the deepFruits project (apple, avocado, capsicum, mango, orange, rockmelon and strawberry). The total number of bounding box instances of the dataset is 162 k and it is ready to use from a cloud service. For the evaluation of the dataset, Yolov5 single stage detector is exploited and reported impressive mean-average-precision, mAP([0.5:0.95]) results of min:0.49, max:0.812. We hope these datasets are useful and serve as a baseline for future studies.

AB  - Today, it seems necessary to study and analyze the uncertainty in any plan, so that without considering and analyzing the uncertainty, the occurrence of undesired situations whose occurrence challenges the objectives of a plan is unexpected. The uncertainty is an integral part of hydrological and hydraulic models, and a proper evaluation of uncertainties in hydrological and hydraulic models may help avoid risky decisions, and high costs in product life cycle and design of structures. The purpose of this study is to predict and analyze the flood risk zone in different probabilities and investigate the role of uncertainty related to inlet flow hydrograph and Manning's roughness coefficient in river flood zone in Seymareh river. The first step was flood zoning using the Hydrologic Engineering Center-River Analysis System model (Hec-Ras). Then, using synthetic data generation, 3049-year-old series of synthetic peak discharges were generated for 2-, 5-, 10-, 25-, 50- and 100-year return periods. Finally, using the discharge-probability curve, the probable boundaries of the river flood plain were determined at 90 and 10% probability levels, respectively. The results showed that the higher the degree of uncertainty of inflow discharges, the greater the rate of changes in flood and flood zone. In the next step, parameter space sampling (roughness coefficient of flood zone and channel) was performed using Monte Carlo simulation and the model was run 500 times. The simulated flood zone was evaluated based on observational flood zone using the F factor. The response-level curve obtained from Monte Carlo sampling showed that the highest F performance was when the channel roughness coefficient was 0.046 and the flood plain roughness coefficient was 0.058. Then, the uncertainty was determined using the cumulative distribution function of flood zones of the upper and lower limits. The results showed that taking into account the uncertainty threshold of the discharge in all return periods based on probabilities of 18 to 38% is able to cover all risks arising from inaccurate estimation of the flow rate in each return period.

AB  - Water quality index (WQI) has been utilised in many countries and regions as a numeric representation of the condition of water resources. However, the computation of the WQI involves a host of water quality variables. Although machine learning models are proven to be a promising tool to estimate WQI with lesser inputs, sufficient data or samples must be collected so that the machine learning models can be trained well. This exhibits a great challenge in places where there has been a lack of data collection infrastructure to meet the needs of machine learning models. Data scarcity is a major issue to be tackled. This study covered two major rivers that served as water intakes in Peninsular Malaysia (Selangor River and Skudai River), where four synthetic data generation methods, namely the conditional tabular generative adversarial network (CTGAN), the tabular variational autoencoder (TVAE), the Gaussian copula (GC) and the copula generative adversarial network (CopulaGAN), were used to synthesise datasets based on the real dataset. By using the pairwise correlation difference (PCD), Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test, the best synthetic datasets were selected for the two rivers. The CopulaGAN1 and the CopulaGAN2 yielded the best small and large synthetic datasets at Selangor River, scoring the lowest PCD, KLD and KS statistics. For the Skudai River, the TVAE1 and TVAE2 were chosen. The real and synthetic datasets were used to train the back-propagation neural network (BPNN) for the WQI estimation. Based on the various evaluation metrics, it was proven that increasing the size of training data using the synthetic data method had a positive impact on the performance of the BPNN. The BPNN trained with the CopulaGAN2 (at Selangor River) and the TVAE2 (at Skudai River) yielded more accurate estimations compared to those derived from the actual and smaller datasets.
   Data were insufficient to train machine learning model well in developing regions.Synthetic data methods can overcome the data scarcity issue in Malaysia.CopulaGAN and TVAE outperformed other methods at Selangor River and Skudai River.BPNN trained with synthetic datasets estimated WQI with higher accuracy.

AB  - Attacks on computer networks have increased significantly in recent days, due in part to the availability of sophisticated tools for launching such attacks as well as the thriving underground cyber-crime economy to support it. Over the past several years, researchers in academia and industry used machine learning (ML) techniques to design and implement Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSes) for computer networks. Many of these researchers used datasets collected by various organizations to train ML classifiers for detecting intrusions. In many of the datasets used in training ML classifiers in such systems, data are imbalanced (i.e., not all classes had equal number of samples). ML classifiers trained with such imbalanced datasets may produce unsatisfactory results. Traditionally, researchers used over-sampling and under-sampling for balancing data in datasets to overcome this problem. In this work, in addition to random over-sampling, we also used a synthetic data generation method, called Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CTGAN), to balance data and study their effect on the performance of various widely used ML classifiers. To the best of our knowledge, no one else has used CTGAN to generate synthetic samples to balance intrusion detection datasets. Based on extensive experiments using widely used datasets NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15, we found that training ML classifiers on datasets balanced with synthetic samples generated by CTGAN increased their prediction accuracy by up to 8% and improved their MCC score by up to 13%, compared to training the same ML classifiers over imbalanced datasets. We also show that this approach consistently performs better than some of the recently proposed state-of-the-art IDSes on both datasets. Our experiments also demonstrate that the accuracy of some ML classifiers trained over datasets balanced with random over-sampling decline compared to the same ML classifiers trained over original imbalanced dataset.

AB  - Synthetic data generation is being increasingly used as a privacy preserving approach for sharing health data. In addition to protecting privacy, it is important to ensure that generated data has high utility. A common way to assess utility is the ability of synthetic data to replicate results from the real data. Replicability has been defined using two criteria: (a) replicate the results of the analyses on real data, and (b) ensure valid population inferences from the synthetic data. A simulation study using three heterogeneous real-world datasets evaluated the replicability of logistic regression workloads. Eight replicability metrics were evaluated: decision agreement, estimate agreement, standardized difference, confidence interval overlap, bias, confidence interval coverage, statistical power, and precision (empirical SE). The analysis of synthetic data used a multiple imputation approach whereby up to 20 datasets were generated and the fitted logistic regression models were combined using combining rules for fully synthetic datasets. The effects of synthetic data amplification were evaluated, and two types of generative models were used: sequential synthesis using boosted decision trees and a generative adversarial network (GAN). Privacy risk was evaluated using a membership disclosure metric. For sequential synthesis, adjusted model parameters after combining at least ten synthetic datasets gave high decision and estimate agreement, low standardized difference, as well as high confidence interval overlap, low bias, the confidence interval had nominal coverage, and power close to the nominal level. Amplification had only a marginal benefit. Confidence interval coverage from a single synthetic dataset without applying combining rules were erroneous, and statistical power, as expected, was artificially inflated when amplification was used. Sequential synthesis performed considerably better than the GAN across multiple datasets. Membership disclosure risk was low for all datasets and models. For replicable results, the statistical analysis of fully synthetic data should be based on at least ten generated datasets of the same size as the original whose analyses results are combined. Analysis results from synthetic data without applying combining rules can be misleading. Replicability results are dependent on the type of generative model used, with our study suggesting that sequential synthesis has good replicability characteristics for common health research workloads.

AB  - Background: The psychological impact of breast cancer (BC) is substantial, with a significant number of patients (up to 32 %) experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Exploring the emotional aspects of PTSD through the functional brain-heart interplay (BHI) offers valuable insights into the condition. BHI examines the functional interactions between cortical and sympathovagal dynamics. This study aims to investigate changes in functional directional BHI after trauma-focused (TF) psychotherapy, specifically Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR), in comparison to treatment as usual (TAU) among BC patients with PTSD. To our knowledge, this study represents the first examination of such changes. Methods: We enrolled thirty BC patients who met the criteria for a PTSD diagnosis, with fourteen receiving EMDR and fifteen receiving TAU over a two- to three-month period. We analyzed changes in the emotional response during a script-driven imagery setting. Quantification of the functional interplay between EEG and sympathovagal dynamics was achieved using the synthetic data generation model (SDG) on electroencephalographic (EEG) and heartbeat series. Our focus was on the difference in the BHI index extracted at baseline and posttreatment. Results: We found statistically significant higher coupling in the heart-to-brain direction in patients treated with EMDR compared to controls. This suggests that the flow of information from the autonomic nervous system to the central nervous system is restored following EMDR-induced recovery from PTSD. Furthermore, we observed a significant correlation between improvements in PTSD symptoms and an increase in functional BHI after EMDR treatment. Conclusions: TF psychotherapy, particularly EMDR, appears to facilitate the restoration of the bottom-up flow of interoceptive information, which is dysfunctional in patients with PTSD. The application of BHI analysis to the study of PTSD not only aids in identifying biomarkers of the disorder but also enhances our understanding of the changes brought about by TF treatments.

AB  - The concept of a digital twin came from the engineering, industrial, and manufacturing domains to create virtual objects or machines that could inform the design and development of real objects. This idea is appealing for precision medicine where digital twins of patients could help inform healthcare decisions. We have developed a methodology for generating and using digital twins for clinical outcome prediction. We introduce a new approach that combines synthetic data and network science to create digital twins (i.e. SynTwin) for precision medicine. First, our approach starts by estimating the distance between all subjects based on their available features. Second, the distances are used to construct a network with subjects as nodes and edges defining distance less than the percolation threshold. Third, communities or cliques of subjects are defined. Fourth, a large population of synthetic patients are generated using a synthetic data generation algorithm that models the correlation structure of the data to generate new patients. Fifth, digital twins are selected from the synthetic patient population that are within a given distance defining a subject community in the network. Finally, we compare and contrast community-based prediction of clinical endpoints using real subjects, digital twins, or both within and outside of the community. Key to this approach are the digital twins defined using patient similarity that represent hypothetical unobserved patients with patterns similar to nearby real patients as defined by network distance and community structure. We apply our SynTwin approach to predicting mortality in a population-based cancer registry (n=87,674) from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program from the National Cancer Institute (USA). Our results demonstrate that nearest network neighbor prediction of mortality in this study is significantly improved with digital twins (AUROC=0.864, 95% CI=0.857-0.872) over just using real data alone (AUROC=0.791, 95% CI=0.781-0.800). These results suggest a network-based digital twin strategy using synthetic patients may add value to precision medicine efforts.

AB  - Limited sample sizes can lead to spurious modeling findings in biomedical research. The objective of this work is to present a new method to generate synthetic populations (SPs) from limited samples using matched case-control data (n = 180 pairs), considered as two separate limited samples. SPs were generated with multivariate kernel density estimations (KDEs) with unconstrained bandwidth matrices. We included four continuous variables and one categorical variable for each individual. Bandwidth matrices were determined with Differential Evolution (DE) optimization by covariance comparisons. Four synthetic samples (n = 180) were derived from their respective SPs. Similarity between observed samples with synthetic samples was compared assuming their empirical probability density functions (EPDFs) were similar. EPDFs were compared with the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) test statistic based on the Kernel Two-Sample Test. To evaluate similarity within a modeling context, EPDFs derived from the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) scores and residuals were summarized with the distance to the model in X-space (DModX) as additional comparisons.
   Four SPs were generated from each sample. The probability of selecting a replicate when randomly constructing synthetic samples (n = 180) was infinitesimally small. MMD tests indicated that the observed sample EPDFs were similar to the respective synthetic EPDFs. For the samples, PCA scores and residuals did not deviate significantly when compared with their respective synthetic samples.
   The feasibility of this approach was demonstrated by producing synthetic data at the individual level, statistically similar to the observed samples. The methodology coupled KDE with DE optimization and deployed novel similarity metrics derived from PCA. This approach could be used to generate larger-sized synthetic samples. To develop this approach into a research tool for data exploration purposes, additional evaluation with increased dimensionality is required. Moreover, given a fully specified population, the degree to which individuals can be discarded while synthesizing the respective population accurately will be investigated. When these objectives are addressed, comparisons with other techniques such as bootstrapping will be required for a complete evaluation.

AB  - A large amount of personal health data that is highly valuable to the scientific community is still not accessible or requires a lengthy request process due to privacy concerns and legal restrictions. As a solution, synthetic data has been studied and proposed to be a promising alternative to this issue. However, generating realistic and privacy-preserving synthetic personal health data retains challenges such as simulating the characteristics of the patients' data that are in the minority classes, capturing the relations among variables in imbalanced data and transferring them to the synthetic data, and preserving individual patients' privacy. In this paper, we propose a differentially private conditional Generative Adversarial Network model (DP-CGANS) consisting of data transformation, sampling, conditioning, and network training to generate realistic and privacy-preserving personal data. Our model distinguishes categorical and continuous variables and transforms them into latent space separately for better training performance. We tackle the unique challenges of generating synthetic patient data due to the special data characteristics of personal health data. For example, patients with a certain disease are typically the minority in the dataset and the relations among variables are crucial to be observed. Our model is structured with a conditional vector as an additional input to present the minority class in the imbalanced data and maximally capture the dependency between variables. Moreover, we inject statistical noise into the gradients in the networking training process of DP-CGANS to provide a differential privacy guarantee. We extensively evaluate our model with state-of-the-art generative models on personal socio-economic datasets and real-world personal health datasets in terms of statistical similarity, machine learning performance, and privacy measurement. We demonstrate that our model outperforms other comparable models, especially in capturing the dependence between variables. Finally, we present the balance between data utility and privacy in synthetic data generation considering the different data structures and characteristics of real-world personal health data such as imbalanced classes, abnormal distributions, and data sparsity.

AB  - Introduction Extracting beat-by-beat information from electrocardiograms (ECGs) is crucial for various downstream diagnostic tasks that rely on ECG-based measurements. However, these measurements can be expensive and time-consuming to produce, especially for long-term recordings. Traditional ECG detection and delineation methods, relying on classical signal processing algorithms such as those based on wavelet transforms, produce high-quality delineations but struggle to generalise to diverse ECG patterns. Machine learning (ML) techniques based on deep learning algorithms have emerged as promising alternatives, capable of achieving similar performance without handcrafted features or thresholds. However, supervised ML techniques require large annotated datasets for training, and existing datasets for ECG detection/delineation are limited in size and the range of pathological conditions they represent.Methods This article addresses this challenge by introducing two key innovations. First, we develop a synthetic data generation scheme that probabilistically constructs unseen ECG traces from "pools" of fundamental segments extracted from existing databases. A set of rules guides the arrangement of these segments into coherent synthetic traces, while expert domain knowledge ensures the realism of the generated traces, increasing the input variability for training the model. Second, we propose two novel segmentation-based loss functions that encourage the accurate prediction of the number of independent ECG structures and promote tighter segmentation boundaries by focusing on a reduced number of samples.Results The proposed approach achieves remarkable performance, with a F1-score of 99.38% and delineation errors of 2.19 +/- 17.73 ms and 4.45 +/- 18.32 ms for ECG segment onsets and offsets across the P, QRS, and T waves. These results, aggregated from three diverse freely available databases (QT, LU, and Zhejiang), surpass current state-of-the-art detection and delineation approaches.Discussion Notably, the model demonstrated exceptional performance despite variations in lead configurations, sampling frequencies, and represented pathophysiology mechanisms, underscoring its robust generalisation capabilities. Real-world examples, featuring clinical data with various pathologies, illustrate the potential of our approach to streamline ECG analysis across different medical settings, fostered by releasing the codes as open source.
